Hilda Ryan-Purcell,"I have the very same expression as the instigator of this discussion - and it works for me too - every time. Why is it then marked as 'wrong'? Can staff come in on this one? Oops sorry. My expression is as follows:s1.find((s2), s1.find (s2)+1)This does work for me every time - why is it marked as wrong?? Oh - I've just got an email as follows ref the above:""that code should be fine. the problem is the extra brackets probably don't match the answer that is expected, and the programme that processes the answer probably doesn't ""parse away"" the extra pair of brackets.""...So PLEASE someone can you get my mark back as I've now used up all my 5 attempts!!! ""I'm glad that you finally figured out what you did wrong (the brackets), but if you have used your 5 tries, I'm afraid that's it. You don't get more chances. Everyone gets 5 tries. At least you know the right answer now. Good luck."" -....But my point is that, even though there was an extra bracket in the expression, the expression worked and produced the desired result every time. The same expression was included in my 5th attempt at the homework - so it should have been marked as correct. Would you not agree??

Whether it's brackets or spaces the code worked in python shell.Is it mentioned anywhere in the training that, unless we get the code absolutely correct, (spaces, brackets etc.) - whether it works on python or not - marks will not be given.

Immanuel Smits,"Don't know if you had your question answered but consider the datatypes of 'False' and False. ï_One is a string type while the other is a boolean type. ï_The automarker is expecting a boolean. The newline character doesn't terminate a file. ï_An empty string ('') does. ï_So you will need to change your while loop condition fromï_while line != 'n'to check for '' instead. Make sense? The infinite loop is still there. ï_Your program continues to loop -- you just don't see anything in the results.I would suggest that you focus on changing your while loop condition. ï_As it stands, your while loop is basically looking for an ""empty""ï_line. ï_You could try inserting a blank line between two of the lines in road.txt. ï_You will notice that processing will stop at the blank line. Are there spaces in the blank line between the paragraphs? ï_If you're working on a Windows machine, you might also check for 'rn'. ï_Windows tends to use the ""Carriage Return"" + ""Linefeed"" ('r' + 'n') as a line ending.So if you want to stop processing at a blank line, you could change your while loop towhile line != 'rn':",0
Yeray Navarro Suarez,"I went wrong to some questions because of this, it confuses me, so then I discovered that the print(""prints the string as it is normal text"") but when using as variable values it introduced de ' comas '. I used (str) -> number but it didnï_t work, this is the most similar thing I find to this what he explained. (number) -> number, but it was wrong, but the explantion says:The answer is of the form: (____) -> ____ where the lines are replaced with Python types to describe the parameter(s) and return value. When referring to a string, use str. When referring to an integer, use int. I was not so far away from (str), so maybe is (str) -> int, but in that why they use this?, (number) -> number , it confuses me. The other option to this is (word) -> number. Yes, that is the answer, (str) -> int. So I should think that number is used when you can have either float or int. What you says seems to be logic, and I tried again and yessss, i the correct answer, but read this explanation of the next question, which correct answer was (word): Here are two example calls for the function count_vowels:>>> count_vowels(""moose"") 3 >>> count_vowels(""scratch"") 1 Which of the following would be the best name for the count_vowels parameter? vowels word CORRECT ONE input int ExplanationParameter names should not be too generic (input could equally well describe the parameters to any function). Types, like str and int, should NOT be used as parameter names.It, confuses a little bit, itï_s like getting the driving license in Spain, hahahah.ï_Thankï_s Alain I have it now completely clear. When you write a function you have to put some information, so you can know what that function do, I think itï_s ok until here. In that information you put an example of what it do>>> count_vowels(""moose"") 3 >>> count_vowels(""scratch"") 1ï_A description:ï_ï_ The functionï_count_vowelsï_returns the number of vowels in a given word (aï_str)And the type contract that especifies what type of (parameter/s) -> values returns.All together looks like this:""""""ï_ï_ï_ (parameter type) -> value typeï_ï_ ï_ï_ï_ The functionï_count_vowelsï_returns the number of vowels in a given word (aï_str)ï_ï_ï_ >>> count_vowels(""moose"")ï_ï_ï_ 3 ï_ï_ï_ >>> count_vowels(""scratch"")ï_ï_ï_ 1""""""For example: Functiondef hello(myname): this is the parameter and is a string (str)ï_ï_ï_ return 'Hello!

Is normal, but is important to keep it in mind, when you have thousand of code lines. Youï_ve got the right answer here. Hi, I subscribe to the course when it was advanced, I subscribe at night so I started the next day, I saw al videos and when I did de first excercise I found that I couldnï_t have credits because the hardline expired the day before. My question is, if you let people subscribe once the course is started, you should put a hardline in base of when people subscribe, otherwise itï_s not fair. I did everything in one day, tomorrow I will be up to date with everything, (video lectures, exercises and second assigment) even when I started two weeks later, but I donï_t have the same chance to get the credits of the first excercise just because I started one day later from hardline. Please think about it.Regardï_s, Yeray For me everything matters, the information and the certificate. I donï_t miss anything, I have done in two weeks what others have done in four, and making other courses too, and Iï_m still in time, as I said, I will finish week 4 tomorrow (today) and assingment 4. I would think is not fair even in a real class. Is great to study here, but because I make the effort and take it seriously I think also it was fair for me to ask for it. I donï_t think I am doing aynthing wrong, just asking or sending a thought.Anyway, I love coursera and the opportunity I have to study, but that doesnï_t mean that I cannot talk about something that could make coursera much more better than it is now. Regardï_s Sure Tom you are right, but I havenï_t say that others cannot share their opinionï_s . Thankï_s anonymous, it would be great if I could add that 5% but anyway, I think is a good idea for the future to think about cases like this one, coursera is incredible and it can be much more perfect, than it is. Alain, I have been working for 5 years as web designer. I donï_t write code, that is why Iï_m here to finally learn to write it, but I have seen and manipulate it too many times to know that implementing that is not a big deal. I donï_t think it will change the hole business model, to give a few more days in base of when you start the course, as I said, if you let people start later, let them get the chance to get their credits in some way. I didnï_t found any answers even I started the course two weeks later, and that is because you cannot give any answer doesnï_t matter how much time has passed. Forum code of coduct3. Post appropriate content. Content that violates the Honor Code or Terms of Service is not permitted. What is Honor Code?3. I will not make solutions to homework, quizzes or exams available to anyone else. This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any official solutions provided by the course staff.But in case you could give answers, lots of forums has an option called spoliers, and there can be the answers if ithey has to be.You are talkiing about special deadline, I am talking about a deadline according to when you start the course, or at least give two days from the day you start. In a place with honest people it should not be a problem, and all these is based in honesty, so time really doesnï_t matters.Now I ask you, imagine a person that discover the course in week number seven, they let them do the course, this guy has time and study hard in one week to make all video lectures, exercises and assigments, but he probably wouldï_t get the certificate because he started later. Do you really think the effort of that guy doesnï_t deserve that credits beacuse is not fair for the rest of students even if he worked as harder or more than others?. Why should others get the certificate and that person not beacuse he started later?, in equal conditions and being honest with the work, even having less time, he is deserving the credits and certificate. Extreme case but is an example to explain my point of view.Anyway nice conversationHave a nice day... or night What I understand is that the expression should find de second occurrence of s2s2 = B A N A N A - second occurrenceand if that occurrence doesnï_t happen in s1:s1 - B A N A N Aï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ B A N A N Aï_return -1For me the confussing word is occurrence, does it mean coincidence or letter?, is not the same to get the second letter of the s2 or the second occurrence(coincidence?, repetition?).If this is the case s2 = B A N A N Aï_s1 should be a long word that repeats otherwise the operation wonï_t continue.Can you clear me these? Hi, are these the results I should espect if the code is correct?>>> index_occu('banana', 'banana')-1>>> index_occu('banana', 'bana')-1>>> index_occu('banana', 'ana')3>>> index_occu('banana', 'b')-1>>> index_occu('banana', 'anan')-1>>> index_occu('banana', 'an')3>>> index_occu('banana', 'na')4>>> index_occu('banana', 'nana')-1>>> index_occu('banana', 'p')-1>>> index_occu('banana', 'a')3>>> index_occu('banana', 'n')4>>> index_occu('banana', 'ba')-1 Why did they deleted the comments, there was no code written, I donï_t understan, I have seen posts with most of the correct code in there, and they are not deleted and the comments dissapears?, no one has told me the answer just told me if these examples are correct, whatï_s the problem with that?, there are also examples in the exercise. If there is any doubt about it I can paste all comments here and see there is nothing strange related with the honor code. I hope it is an error. Dipali, your code is giving the index of the first occurrence in s1:B A N A N AA P P L Eyou have to finish the code so you can get the index of the second occurrence in s1:B A N A N AA P P L EAs you know if there is no occurrence results -1 and should be in one expression. Try to keep your expression as clear and simple as you can. Anyway you are going in the right way but your code is not finished. With this simple function Return None, also returns nothing:def test(s, i):ï_ï_ï_ if s < i:ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ print('ok')ï_ï_ï_ else:ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ return None Also I am having problems with the type contract:ï_ >>> last_vowel(""cauliflower"")ï_ï_ï_ ""e""Should be:ï_ >>> last_vowel(""cauliflower"")ï_ï_ï_ 'e'Otherwise the doctest.testmod() give an example failure :Failed example:ï_ï_ï_ last_vowel('cauliflower')Expected:ï_ï_ï_ ""e""Got:ï_ï_ï_ 'e'But if I change that and delete de None from de type contract:ï_ >>> last_vowel(""pfft"") '''ï_everything goes fine. So we have two options to choose. >>> last_vowel(""pfft"") '''orreturn print(None)I am not going to think much more, I see it clear, the code do what it is supposed to do, give the last vowel or None (nothing). What I did also passed the doctest, and there is no need to change (str) -> str | None. If I have to change somenthing I would change return print(None), is more logic for me than adding str | None. def last_vowel(s):ï_ï_ï_ '''(str) -> strï_ï_ï_ Return the last vowel in s if one exists; otherwise, return None.ï_ï_ ï_ï_ï_ï_ >>> last_vowel('cauliflower')ï_ï_ï_ 'e'ï_ï_ï_ >>> last_vowel('pfft') # returns Noneï_ï_ï_ Noneï_ï_ï_ '''ï_ï_ï_ i = len(s) - 1ï_ï_ï_ while i >= 0:ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ if s[i] in 'aeiouAEIOU':ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ return s[i]ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ i = i - 1ï_ï_ï_ return print(None)This is the same, and passes doctest perfectly. Yeah I understand, you are right, but the code is in the case you want you print None, you can print whatever you want, but cases are different and they must be treated in different ways. There is the other way just leaving it blank and use return None. >>> last_vowel('pfft') ï_ '''It also pass the doctest and It is returning None (or blank). I donï_t think is at all neccesary to use ""or None"", is obvious that if there are no vowels it will return None(nothing), as you say is a documentation for ourselves. I donï_t think my code is doing something oppossed to what it has to do, I think is doing it in a different way, maybe not the best, but the function is returning the values it has to return in this context. For me this second option is the best.One thing, the code you wrote will give a syntax error. try to indent correctly>>> while colour != '': (if you press enter here it will indent in the right place.)ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ colours.append(colour)ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ colour = input(prompt) while colour != '':This means that while colour is not empty string it would ask for more colours, when you press enter without typing a colour, you are returning a empty string '' so it stops.

Jeff JIN Bo,"Hi, RachelA. The first two error message(insert_sequence) shows that the test program try to insert the sequence at beginning/end of the other sequence. e.g. insert ""AT"" at position 0 of ""ATCG"" will get ""ATATCG"", insert ""AT"" at position 4 of ""ATCG"" will get ""ATCGAT""Think your program only handle how to insert in between. B. Error 3(insert_sequence) and 4(get_complementary_sequence) and 6(get_complement) shows that your program fail to exercise the example in handout, you may need to check your code.C. Error 5(get_complementary_sequence) shows that the test might use a really long sequence(may be 100+ char) to test your program and failed. So I guess your program can handle short sequence, your need to make it possible to handle sequence of any lengthD. Failure 7(is_valid_sequence) is testing you program with a empty string """", in this assignment, this will be consider as a valid sequenceHope these will be helpful to you Hi Anna, your problem comes with the two identical letters in a row.Since you use e.index(i), it will locate the first appearance of i in that particular row. if you have rows looks like ['T', 'T'], the value evaluated will always be 0.To verify this, you can test you code with column_index = 0, you should get a 3 letter string.Hint for you, you can save the inner for loop. By evaluating e(column_index), you should get what you want.Hope these will help There is an easier way to complete the same task. You can study a bit on the answers of Q11 and Q12 in this week's exercise.",0

Hi, Anne!Visualizer helps me alot with such a mistakes. Try to print out the result with valid sequence, then check the position of your first 'else' statement.

Penny Lee,"I submitted my assignment twice but I am still having a little problem with the get_complementary_sequence because my code did not pass all the tests. Since I have a background in biology, when I read the description of the get_complementary_sequence function, I immediately thought of this as finding the reverse complement of a sequence. And it seemed to be true, because the auto-grader used the sequence 'GCTAGCTA' and expected it to return 'TAGCTAGC'. Like the name implies, first you take the complement of 'GCTAGCTA' (which is 'CGATCGAT') then reverse it to get 'TAGCTAGC'.So I was kind of confused when I saw that the example given in the handout stated that if we call this function with 'AT' as the argument, it returns 'TA'. However, using the same rule for the longer sequence, should not the function return 'AT' instead of 'TA'? Otherwise it is just returning the complement of 'AT'. I see. Yeah that message generated by the autograder really confused me. But now I know they are not looking for the reverse complement. Thanks a bunch!!!ï_ Mystery case closed.

Hello!Here's my suggestion :def Combinations(nbr_letters): combinations = [] # list of combinations (type string) codes = [] # list of letter ASCII codes for current combination # initialise combination for i in range(0, nbr_letters): codes.append(65) last = nbr_letters - 1 # index of last letter in combination while True: # convert numeric combination to string representation combination = '' for i in codes: combination += chr(i) # store string representation of current combination combinations.append(combination) # if last letter is 'Z' (ASCII 90) if codes[last] == 90: # set to 'A' codes[last] = 65 # initialise index of previous letter i = last - 1 # while index of previous letter is valid while i >= 0: # if previous letter is 'Z' if codes[i] == 90: # set to 'A' codes[i] = 65 # move one letter backward (and re-enter loop) i -= 1 else: # increment letter codes[i] += 1 # exit from loop break # this part is executed when the while condition evaluates to false (*not* through a ""break"" statement). Practically, it means that the following code will be executed when all letters are 'Z' else: # exit from main loop (refers to ""while True"") break # if last letter isn't 'Z' else: # increment letter codes[last] += 1 print('(All combinations found)') for combination in combinations: print(combination)Sorry if it's neither elegant nor simple.And thanks for posting a challenge! Hello DianeThank you for your comment.Concerning the character-set, the function was intentionally coded to shift only alphabetic characters regardless of case, preserving capitalisation, punctuation and all non-alphabetic content.As to the ""greater than"" sign, where in the code do you think it would be needed? Of course, there's more than one way to approach a problem, and nobody's claiming to hold the ultimate solution. Besides, being a total beginner in Python, I think code optimisation concerns should come at a later time, when we're better acquainted with Python's idioms. But it's only my approach. Hello LakkaMay I contribute?Your code first converts the sentence to lower case, but, later on, tests whether letters are lower case or not. Perhaps you could change ""for letter in sentence.lower()"" to ""for letter in sentence"", and rely on the ""if letter.islower()"" conditional statement.By the way, it's ""islower()"" (without parentheses, it seemingly evaluates to method address).It's very convenient that Python has built-in string methods such as isalpha and islower! Hello DianeA few remarks on your code.Your code refers to shift as a global variable in function find_let, but you commented out its declaration, which results in a compile (or whatever the name of that stage) error. Besides, If you want shift to be a global variable, you needn't pass it as an argument to translate().Another issue is that when shift is assigned user input in caesar(), it really is a local variable (no global declaration there), and (global) variable shift in function find_let() doesn't refer to the same variable. Addingdef caesar():ï_ï_ï_ global shiftwill fix this.Global variable caes is initialised to a list containing an empty string as its first element. The following would do just fine :caes = []With caes being defined as global, it means that function translate() appends characters to global variable caes, then returns it, which is in turn assigned to local variable caes in function caesar().alph is used in your code to test if a character is lower case alphabetic, to return its numeric index, or to return the letter corresponding to a numeric index. Now that you're more familiar with ASCII codes, you could use the ord() function to get letter codes, chr() to get letter from code, and Python's built-in string method isalpha() (as illustrated by Lakka's post below) to test if characters belong to the alphabet.Furthermore, you define variables c and d as global, and initialise them to an empty string. C is used in translate() and d in find_let() but nowhere in those functions are they declared as global, so it means that global variables c and d are practically never used.Finally, concerning your find_let() function, if you wish to make your code shorter, you can notice that you d = alph[t] assignment occurs in both parts of your conditional test. You can safely move this assignment outside of it, like this :def find_let(b): global shift, t, ceas if b + shift >= 26: t = int((b + shift) % 26) else: t = int(b + shift) d = alph[t] return dHere's an update suggestion for your code (tested in IDLE). Hello! Here is my attempt :def trip_time(): # initialise <place> and <total_time> place = 'place1' total_time = time_to_go(place) # add time for next places to go while place != 'place4': place = next_place(place) total_time += time_to_go(place) return total_time def round_trip(): total_time = trip_time() return '{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(int(total_time // 60), int(total_time % 60), int((total_time * 60) % 60))Thanks for the exercise! Nice of you to have gone to the trouble of benchmarking the code.I wasn't aware that Python permitted list assignments, and now we know that's it convenient and efficient! Yes, the XOR method is slower, as indicated by the user/sys times in Etienne's benchmark tests (and confirmed by time.clock benchmarking on my own machine as well).He probably meant that list assignments are the ""poorest man's swap"" in that time is money, and the poorest man can only afford the fastest code. Or something... welcome :-) Looks definitely Pythonic (Pythonish?) ... and somewhat mysterious too. Good going! Like this?def XOR_sentence(sentence, encoding): '''(str, str) -> str Perform a binary XOR on all characters of <sentence> with those of <encoding> string. If <encoding> string is shorter than <sentence>, its characters are cyclically repeated to match <sentence> length.

Actually this code was written as a response to ""anonymous"", who said :>> Another last fence of a defense for the encrypted message (that is used even today) would>> be to ""xor"" the encrypted message letters with some method before returning from the>> encryption function.(see above)So this function is intended as a complement to another encryption function. It was poor wording on my part, sorry. I just meant that the ""zip()"" seemed exotic to the beginner that I am. Taking a closer look at it now, it looks like a multiple list iteration tool. Thank you :-)As for the ':02d', I thought something like ""6:5:3"" would look somewhat wrong as a time string. @ EtienneAgreed! Here's a another variation:def sym_string(sentence, key): '''(str, str) -> str Return a string consisting of each character of <sentence> mirrored against the corresponding character of <key>. Mirroring is defined as taking the symmetrical opposite of a character within a character set. a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z <<< char-set | | | mirrored ---- | --- input character character | ---- key = axis Formula : mirrored = (len(charset) + key + (key - input)) % len(charset) Note : the character-set can also be randomly shuffled.

Precondition : n is a positive integer Example : >>> Collatz_sequence(10) [10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1] ''' sequence = [n] while n != 1: n = n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else 3 * n + 1 sequence.append(n) return sequencedef Collatz_seq_length(n): '''(int) -> int Return the length of a Collatz sequence for a given number <n> (without actually determining the sequence contents).

The ""brute-force"" approach consists in calculating sequence length for every number of the input range. Example : >>> Collatz_biggest_sequence(1000) 871 ''' winning_number = 2 max_length = 2 for i in range(2, n + 1): length = Collatz_seq_length(i) if length > max_length: max_length = length winning_number = i return winning_numberdef Collatz_biggest_sequence2(n): # ""I've already done that"" approach '''(int) -> int return the integer from range [2 .. <n>], which produces the longest Collatz sequence. This function keeps track of already calculated sequence lengths. For instance, if we already know that number 3 produces an 8 member sequence, to determine the length for number 12 we only need apply the Collatz formula twice : 12 => 6 6 => 3 and add 2 to the already known sequence length for number 3. Example : >>> Collatz_biggest_sequence(1000) 871 ''' known = {1: 1} max_length = 1 winning_number = 1 for i in range(2, n + 1): n = i length = 0 while not n in known: length += 1 n = n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else 3 * n + 1 known[i] = known[n] + length for i in known.keys(): if known[i] > max_length: max_length = known[i] winning_number = i return winning_number# --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---def Print_sequence(n): # for task 1 seq = Collatz_sequence(n) print('Collatz sequence for', n, 'is :n') print(', '.join([str(i) for i in seq])) print('n(',len(seq),' elements)', sep='') def Print_longest_sequence(n): # for task 2 i = Collatz_biggest_sequence2(n) print('Of all numbers up to', n,', number', i, 'produces the longest sequence.') Print_sequence(i) Tasks #1 and #2 are handled by the last two routines. I agree the question's wording is quite confusing.IMO, it would have made more sense formulated this way :which English expression is always true for all the caseswhen the boolean expression evaluates to True. The question is :Which English sentence is true exactly when the Boolean expression evaluates to True?When the boolean expression evaluates to True, sentences B, C and D may be true.Yes, sentence B covers the other two possibilities, and yes, the boolean expression is what one would write to test if the student got at least one of his/her exams, but my point is whether the question is clearly and unambiguously worded. Believe it or not, but we all know what frustration feels like, especially with computer programming. Now the forums are there for people of varying degrees of experience to share their knowledge and help each other. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you've had no forum activity prior to starting this thread, which means that you haven't actually given anybody a chance to help you before you came up complaining of 'smugness' and 'bad pedagogy'.Feel free to ask as many questions as needed, you'll see that nobody wants you to feel like a 'foreigner'.Also, perhaps the anthropologist in you would agree that voicing your dismay in a less theatrical manner would certainly yield more constructive feedback. Nancy, I'll be pleased to offer you and Joseph my help with any programming problem you may have, if you ever bother asking it in a considerate way. Citing the IDLE help() function about and :The expression x and y first evaluates x; if x is false, itsvalue is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting valueis returned.Note that neither and nor or restrict the value and type theyreturn to False and True, but rather return the last evaluatedargument.cents is evaluated to True (non-zero), so it evaluates dollars and returns its value.But if you had written :cents = 0dollars = 53the expression cents and dollars would evaluate to 0 (as the first value equates to False)Hope that helps! Thanks for your comment, Michael, and I'm glad if you found this code useful to get started on the second part. I am not very comfortable with recursion, but yes, you can calculate the length using recursion, just like the code you've posted below, it's very good.Also, don't let my lengthy code postings give you false impressions, I'm a beginner just like you, only with some Perl background :-)I hope to see your solution to part #2 (even if you feel like copying someone else in the beginning, you'll take ownership of the code in the process of writing and you will perhaps find new ways --- try it!). Shouldn't a variable that represents whether a non-nucleotide was found be initialised to False, and set to True if a non-nucleotide character is found, or am I just tired? Sorry, I was focusing on the wording, here.A Boolean variable that represents whether you have found a non-nucleotide characterHow would you interpret such a variable holding the True value?Since it represents whether a non-nucleotide character has been found, if it's True, then it means the sequence is unvalid. Then according to the description :the variable is initialised to True (a non-nucleotide has been found, and the sequence is invalid)the variable is set to False (no invalid character found) if you find something that isn't a nucleotideIt simply doesn't make sense.Either that Boolean variable represents whether all the characters are valid :all_valid is initialised to Trueall_valid is set to False if you find something that isn't an 'A', 'T', 'C' or 'G'or the variable really indicates if a non-nucleotide was found and non_nucleotide_found is initialised to Falsenon_nucleotide_found is set to True if you find something that isn't an 'A', 'T', 'C' or 'G' No I'm not ""overthinking"", I'm reporting what I believe to be an illogical phrasing.My post isn't concerned with the purpose of the function ""is_valid_sequence"". It is fairly obvious that its return value should reflect whether an invalid character was found or not.My point is that a Boolean variable that is said ""to represent whether a non-nucleotide was found"", shouldn't be initialised to True and set to False upon encountering a non-nucleotide character.That wording is illogical. >> the boolean does not hold the value of whether a non-nucleotide sequence was foundNo kidding?So, when you read this sentence:use a Boolean variable that represents whether you have found a non-nucleotide characteryou understand that ""the boolean does not hold the value of whether a non-nucleotide sequence was found""? What I mean is, the phrasing would make more sense (to me) if the original text:Another way is to use a Boolean variable that represents whether you have found a non-nucleotide character; it would start off as True and would be set to False if you found something that wasn't an 'A', 'T', 'C' or 'G'.was changed into :Another way is to use a Boolean variable that represents whether you have found a non-nucleotide character; it would start off as False and would be set to True if you found something that wasn't an 'A', 'T', 'C' or 'G'. >> It never says to set it to True if you find one, in fact it says just the oppositeOn this we agree. It says to set it to False if you find one. And that's the problem.Yes, there is a whole sentence there, and that whole sentence suggests using a variable that represents whether a non-nucleotide was found, initialise it to True and set it to false if you find incorrect characters. A more logical approach (and wording), in my opinion, would recommend setting the opposite values. Made the same mistake :-)They seem to consider that a zero length sequence is valid.You should have something likestudent: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_zero_lengthin your assignment report, but are there other problems reported? Yes, zero-length is valid. Thank you Kevin, and I apologize for prompting such a lengthy thread over a language detail. Was not much inspired by prime numbers.Here is to test primality:def is_prime(number): for n in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1): if number % n == 0: print(""found divisor"", n) return False else: return TrueAnd this, to find a list of prime numbers:def prime_list(number): primes = [] limit = None for n in range(2, number + 1): limit = int(n ** 0.5) for divisor in primes: if n % divisor == 0: break elif divisor > limit: primes.append(n) break else: primes.append(n) return primes Hello folks! This is my attempt. The game works with these data files.[ edited ] Oops, thanks for reporting this. I used the visualiser website as a pastebin alternative but that wasn't a good idea. Edited. To discourage players from peeking into the data file and cheat :-PData file #1 gives me no error locally. Strange. I don't understand anything to encoding issues (run into them while experimenting with a different scrambling function which produced characters outside of regular ascii char-set).Checking with Notepadd++, all 3 files have ANSI encoding, not UTF-8, and they work fine just as they are (for me, that is). Very nice!Did you learn doing graphics by following the Interactive Programming in Python course? Nice game, Dmytro. Only, when run from IDLE, it seems to launch a console window once in a while (whenever a clear-screen is attempted?). Yeah, it's a pity IDLE doesn't seem to offer more text-control functionalities. Can't wait to see what Interactive Programming has in store for us. Just a remark, big words seem to stretch partly outside of the visible window into the 5th dimension. Coming from a Perl and Javascript background, and I'm impressed by Python. Its list oriented statements are dense and powerful, its emphasis on code documentation is most welcome (can't wait to take Crafting Quality Code, by the way) and overall it gives an impression of being a mature, orderly and friendly language. It looks strangely familiar :-P Finally found my way through it, although by using most unscientific trial-and-error.6d217e392d7e312d397c28272c222c2d2c39287f392d217e397f222b2c2d392d212b7e7e39297a2b7a202b7a29212c397f2b2826393b6d217e396028257d395b2e203b397b32395e7d207a2b395a25257a273969287e4739622d2c392b7e7a7d22272039307a2c392c2e20207e2c2d7e7d392227397a3929282c2d392227396622277d395f28287d3946395e312d2b7a39307e7e242532397c217a25257e27207e393c4b47396d217e396e6b6539307a2c39212d2d295348487b2828242c477e2c7e2b2f7e2b47282b20487f227c2d2228274829287e482028257d7b2e2047212d2625Will post the code later.Good luck Ravi.

I suspect this error comes from this piece of code in the read_words function:open_words_file=open(words_file, 'r')Although the function gives good results it is not accepted by theï_ auto grader.Why isn't it allowed to use this code? As the file ""wordlist1.txt"" resides on disk with locationï_'/Volumes/RAM Disk/wordlist1.txt' I have to open it in memory before I can do something with it. So opening it must be done in the function definition.So I don't understand the implication of what you are saying about a file that is already open.When I call my function with:read_words('/Volumes/RAM Disk/wordlist1.txt')it gives the correct result:['CRUNCHY', 'COWS', 'EAT', 'GRASS']Conclusion: although the function acts correctly, the auto grader does not accept it for formal reasons that I do not understand. Very frustrating indeed.ï_ Thank you Christos for your comment. This thread can be closed. So no opening and no closing calls in the function definition? I stripped the opening and the closing call to the file from my function definition. After that it was accepted by the auto grader.student: test_a3.Test_03_IsValidWord.test_01_return_typeSUCCESSThank you Anonymous (who ever you are) and Vikki Ha for your help. Dear Staff,The problem is fixed. Thank you. I got the same problem: how does the board have to look like?My board looks like this:['EFJAJCOWSS', 'SDGKSRFDFF', 'ASRJDUSKLK', 'HEANDNDJWA', 'ANSDNCNEOP', 'PMSNFHHEJE', 'JEPQLYNXDL']Is this OK? So I got this board_list: a list of 7 string elements.['EFJAJCOWSS', 'SDGKSRFDFF', 'ASRJDUSKLK', 'HEANDNDJWA', 'ANSDNCNEOP', 'PMSNFHHEJE', 'JEPQLYNXDL']board_list[0] returns as expected the string 'EFJAJCOWSS'list('EFJAJCOWSS') givesï_['E', 'F', 'J', 'A', 'J', 'C', 'O', 'W', 'S', 'S'] that's what I want.To my surprise list(board_list[0])gives the error:ï_TypeError: 'list' object is not callable. Strange as the list object is a string.Now I'm stuck on how to transform the board_list so I get what I want.Your suggestions are very much appreciated.ï_ You're right Tom.I didn't get the error any more.Thank you for your help. The Python Visualiser is great, but cannot be used for functions that need file I/O. Agree to that. The code is not very clear to me.",0

Alexander Falgui,"I am Alexander Beleno Falgui. I live in Philippines.I signed up for this course because i want to strengthen my programming skills in Python. This is one of the course that i should have taken because, the Introduction to Interactive Programming with Python was not for beginners But, it was a fun course. I will make sure that I will pass with Flying colors in this course.I'll look forward to meeting you all in this course :D I already have a Python programming background but, not enough. I expect to learn new things as I didn't get sufficient information from Introduction to Interactive Programming with Python. Since, they focus on games. I expect to learn new basic syntax that I haven't learn before. I expect to improve my programming practice here most of all :D My goal is to learn more about basic programming fundamentals. I want to improve my programming style. I think that I will understand more concepts such as File I/Os, For Loops, Modules and Exceptions. I hope this course will help me develop programs. Good luck fulfilling your goals :D The rules of the variable (I assume) is aligned where Prof Paul drew the base and it's memory address.ï_This might not matter to anyone but, It helps others read the rules without problems if it's somewhere away from the drawings.EDIT: NVM, they showed the rules after discussing about memory addresses. But removing the rules in 04:05 makes the video cleaner :) Python 2.5.1 and Python 3.3.2 are completely different. Like print ""Hello, World"" will not work in Python 3.3.2 because the print statement in 2.5.1 is now a print function as of Python 3.3.2 and raw_input("""") will not work on Python 3.3.2 because it was removed. So there will be a lot of codes that may work on Python 2.5.1 but not in 3.3.2. So The guys above me are correct. Get the 3.3.2 This course is very informative :DIt taught me new things i didn't learn previously like memory addresses and calling functions using the IDLE without calling it using the editor. First week and one of my expectations met :D To become a programmer: You first must have the desire to learn. You can learn algebra, trigonometry, calculus, discrete math and apply it to programming. You must know how Python works and finally, You must be comfortable in solving problems :DKnowing how Python works in a way that you know what to use when your coding.Solving problems in a way of knowing some math I have mentioned and know how to apply it.Of course, you have to LOVE computers and programming. 12/14... I was sure I answered all of them. Can you tell me what's the file size of your download? The successful download file should be 19.8MB. If the file size is under 19.8MB, it means that it failed to download. # I updated it. You said ""Y for join : "" option = input(""Y for join : "")ï_print(""I love to! My answer is %s"" % (option+""es.""))if(""Y"" in option):ï_ï_ï_ï_ print('thx')ï_else:ï_ï_ï_ï_ print('bye')ï_ Output: >>> I love to! My answer is Yes. >>> thx It says it will be released on Monday noon in toronto. It's still Sunday there. According to the announcements. As long as it has Python 3.3.2 Installed. Let's think of it this way:Let's say you created a function called ""area"" and saved the file as triangle.pyIf you run it, you are making the area function accessible to the shell which, allows you to call that function in the shell.Therefore, the def in the file is the same as the def in the shell.I hope i helped. Because you can evaluate expressions in the python shell and it will give you a direct answer.like so:>>> 1 + 1 2 Fast Way:Go to the python shell and press CTRL + NAnd F5 to run it. You are going to need Python 3.3.2 especially in the week 2. Some syntax in python 2 will cause a bug(if not, error) to your program. There might be some bugs in 2,x that 3.x fixed. But there won't be any change in Python 2.x if you installed 3.x as long as you don't overwrite the 2.x directory. If you installed 2.x and 3.x in a different location, you will notice that nothing happened in 2.x. It is because of the Environment variables. Yes. The code used in this course will have no problems with your version. I never knew that there were actually an in-video quiz. Thanks for posting this post :D If you want to access the IDLE, Click Start -> All Programs -> Click the Python 3.3 Folder -> IDLE (Python GUI)Faster Way: Start -> Type Python in the text box below the ""All Programs"" - > Click IDLE (Python GUI)IDLE is not accessible in C:Python33 But it is accessible through start menu. Pin it in the taskbar to save more time. I agree, we need the signature track in this course. https://www.facebook.com/groups/156329477902954/We might find this facebook group useful :D Your python 3.3.2 download must have crashed from a slow internet. As a python programmer, I have not decided whether i should develop desktop apps, web apps, etc..I want to know what possible job positions I will have if i learn python. Assignment 1 will be released in Week 2. So.... were going to have to wait for another week to get it updated. Pretty much most programming language has the order of precedence of C++. I might have confused you.Let me rephrase that question: What possible job position can you get if you add python as a programming language?e.g. Python as a back-end, desktop-gui, etc. Well, the operator used is the floating point division (""/""), In order to return an integer, we need to use the integer division (""//"")Like so:# Floating point division def area(base, height): return base * height / 2 # A single slash means floating point division# Shell >>> area(5, 12) 30.0# Integer division def area(base, height): return base * height // 2 # Double slashes mean integer division# Shell >>> area(5, 12) 30 For now, tryprint(""n"" * 100)or if you have a program, close the IDLE and press run in your editor. That will produce a clean IDLE. I think all the courses offer ""distinction"" as it means : Graduated with honor. I think 90-95% is the minimum grade required to pass with distinction. The video quality button is not visible to me too. I think their goal is to offer high quality videos so we don't have trouble looking at the code and notes.So there is no way to change the video quality. In windows 7 we have a User Account Control, I am sure Windows 8 has some tutorials on how you can lower/disable UAC.My UAC is disabled since, I was annoyed of administrator privileges. But I only disabled UAC because, I don't download any software usually.Here are 5 links to help you control UAC.http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/how-to-disable-user-account-control-in-windows-8/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/hyperyash/archive/2012/07/18/disabling-user-account-control-in-windows-8.aspxhttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-ph/windows7/turn-user-account-control-on-or-offhttp://www.forumswindows8.com/tutorials/disable-uac-windows-8-a-4070.htmhttp://www.eightforums.com/system-security/2434-disable-uac-completely.html IDLE -ï_Integrated DeveLopment EnvironmentIt's the same as IDE but, since Python Programming Language was named after the Monty Python's Flying Circus, IDLE was named after Eric Idle. It's finally released! :D I guess they release the exercises the day after the lectures are released. What does python specialize in?Does python specialize in Desktop Applications, Web Applications or Server-Sided Scripting? It works but it will only confuse the reader and you. Thanks a lot.I hope you succeed at educating them. Yes. It's perfectly the right one. ord function return the integer ordinal of a one-character string.In other words, It returns the integer representing the ASCII.>>> ord('Z')9090 represents the integer of the ASCII letter ""Z""Though, you can only put a character(one-letter string) and not a number. Oh yes! It's simply a fun course. It teaches you the basics, good programming practices and challenges you to do games from text-based games to a real game. It really strengthened my creativity in the last project. You will find the professors amusing.Edit: There are also some practice exercises to help you. Please correct your grammar. I am not even sure if you are asking a question or commenting. I didn't mean to offend you in any way. I just got confused whether you were asking or commenting. Python is like a calculator because typing an expression in the IDLE will give you an answer. Much like in the calculator.>>> 12 + 3 15 >>> 2 - 1 1 >>> 2 * 3 6 >>> 8 / 2 4.0The purpose of this course is to teach you the basics of python. They removed it in order to prevent cheating. The exercise is already released and it would be unfair if you know the answer from the past course. They will make it available until the day of the next session of LTP I is open. It's also good to use the past archive to practice too. There won't be any problems installing both in the same computer. As long as they have different directories. e.g: C:Python27, C:Python33 Can you post the image of the code? Is it Stack Overflow? That's where i found this code.def cls(): print(""n"" * 100) Doesn't seem to have an error in IDLE and editor... Press Enter Twice like Jessica Said. A parameter is aï_named entity in the roundï_function|(or method) definition that specifies anï_argumentThe variable value is an argument because it's a value passed to the round function. Might be a bug. After I did the exercises, i got a point for not checking that. Python is a good choice for introductory programming courses.Python is a pathway for understanding C, C++, Java, etc...Python is versatile.Python is Readable. It makes it easy to be understood by beginners. And of course, It's powerful! If you're using windows, try Ctrl + V. Command + V for mac. It's sad that my C# keeps getting crashed. My internet is so slow to get a new copy. I wanted to enroll in a course called: Beginning Game Programming with C# :( Python and ActiveTcl are different installations. Python doesn't come with ActiveTcl. You can download Python for Mac hereï_http://www.python.org/download Actually, most programming languages have some free IDEs, Compilers and tutorials. Yes. Single slash means floating point division;>>> 4/2 2.0Double slashes mean integer division>>> 4//2 2 Yes. +5 indicates a positive integer while -6 means a negative integer. An expression subtracts when 2 or more operands are evaluated with a minus sign. -6 indicated as a negative because it's only a single operand and it's being expressed as a negative integer. When you're evaluating expressions such as 5 + 6, it won't matter because it's the same as 5+6 but whitespaces increase readability. Python 3.3.2 Windows X86-64 MSI Installerï_is for both x86 and x64 users.But, there is no download for only X64. Well, it's from personal experience. I experienced more Python than Java. And you experienced more Java than Python.But I can say that Java is not that hard to learn compared to C/C++, # Smaller Program option = input(""Y for join : "") print(""Thanks!"") if ""Y"" in option else print(""Bye"") It is necessary. There will be some syntax differences like the print statement became a print function ( print() ) and raw_input became input().It is necessary because some code in Python 3 will have bugs in Python 2.Don't worry, it won't replace 2.7. The Python 3.3.2 has it's own directory and environment variables. It will be present until the the day the next session that this course is offered. The question means: What is the value of x? What is the question? Yes. If you go to Courses -> and select U.S. State Institutions.https://www.coursera.org/course/gameprogrammingThis course starts in September 16 2013. I'll take some C# Tutorials to prepare myself. Not a degree but a statement of accomplishment (certificate) if you reach the grade of %70 or higher. The question never mentioned any level of precision. It just asked you the answer to 12/7 I heard NASA uses python.http://www.python.org/about/success/usa/ The problem is it should have double underscores instead of one.Like these: dir(__builtins__) That is much appreciated. Go to the Python IDLE1. Click Options -> Configure IDLE2. Click Fonts & Tabs3. Click Size (the button)4. Set it to your desired size.5. Click Ok. If you want a different font, change the font to consolas. Or download inconsolatas font. I assume you downloaded and installed Python 3.3.2.There are 2 ways to access IDLE after installation.1. Start Menu -> All Programs -> Python33 -> IDLE(Python GUI)2. Start Menu -> Search for Python in the text box below all programs -> Click IDLE(Python GUI) My post also applies to Windows. My OS is Windows 7 Edit: I'll need to add more details.Here are possible problems:1. The download crashed resulting that the installer is corrupted. You might need to download it again. The required file dize is 19.3MB for x86 and 19.8MB for x64.2. Low admin privileges. Try running it as administrator.3. Firewall Problem. Your firewall must have blocked the installer. For now, try disabling firewall. For a faster way, Press F5 on your editor. Try reading this:ï_http://bugs.python.org/issue15853http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/bugs/1007978 Its no longer crashing. I just figured out I need to run as administrator. Wise idea. But, what will we use to submit the program? Don't forget about.http://learnstreet.com/http://learnpythonthehardway.org/For exercises:http://codingbat.com/ http://programmr.com/ Let's use the Python Visualizer instead. It turns out that we can generate links to save our code in the cloud :) How do you solve the temperatures? I used max and min functions to determine the hottest and coldest.

I also tried that too. it seems that you can't integer divide 2 floats to get a integer as a result. I guess it has to be done explicitly. 8/23/2013 Version:ï_http://pastebin.com/xC5rktW4 Did you got the download file from these two?Python 3.3.2 Windows x86 MSI InstallerPython 3.3.2 Windows X86-64 MSI InstallerI suspect you downloaded the python's source codeï_from this post:ï_https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=116#post-2220 But if you want to learn about the math's built in functions.the code is:import math # You can use the built-in functions like the ones you wrote. # math.log(x), math.sin(x), math.sqrt(x), math.pow(x, y) Errors:1. You forgot to indent the for loop2, The fib = [] on line 3 caused an error..3. The program didn't print out the fibonacci numbers as desired.

The Hard Way Is Easier.learnpythonthehardway.orgDon't feel discouraged, this is actually for beginners :) Yes. There are 10 In-Video quizzes in this week's lectures. In Philippines, it's called 3rd Year high school. Some countries call it (9th Grade or something?)I am 14 years old. As I viewed your profile, we are a year different :) Yes. Please do useï_The Python Visualizerï_and set the version to 3.3 there is a Generate URL button. please post your link when you're done.It would be easier to evaluate that way.I will only say ""Correct"" or ""Wrong"" when I evaluate. The practice wiki is found here:ï_https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/LTP:Practice Let us addprogramr.com I am interested in this course!I am 14 years old, I have some basic programming experience in python.Here are the ranks of programming language I know best.1, Python (I know more of Python)2. C/C++ (I know some intermediate C and a little of C++)3. Java (I know a little about Java) Correct. But, there's a smaller way. Well, the question sometimes varies, so you have to completely analyze the question. And your round() is wrong because the round function must have at least 1 argument. Well, I assume you downloaded the videos instead of watching it in the Video Lectures right?Because that question mark means ""It's time for a quiz"". If you watched in the Video Lectures, you will be asked to answer the following. After the answering. Your video will be marked as ""Quiz Attempted"" for attempting in the quiz. Don't worry, they don't add to your grade, they're just there to help you understand what you've learned. Well, pythontutor is my suggestion, you can pick anything you want as long as it supports python 3 and can provide you a link to post it.Edit: I am evaluating your program:Wow. You really impressed me with those for loops. The roots are fine but, You didn't use the Exponentiation in the power.. There is a smaller way.But ï_you are correct :D Well, your program worked. That's all that matters. These are also good for those who wants to learn more :)http://www.learnstreet.net/http://www.learnpythonthehardway.org/ Sunday. It's not a simple code. And as for a hint: Both of my functions use an exponentiation :) I assume you have installed python.Click Start Menu -> All Programs -> Python 3.3 -> IDLE(Python GUI) Correct! Your return statements matched mine. :)It's not really cheating if your source code isn't copy/pasted from another programmer's python program. Don't worry, I'll make my puzzles more complex in a later time. I make puzzles that need skills based on what the course contains that is already covered. Replace print(degree, 'ïçF')ï_to return(degree, 'ïçF')It removes the annoying ""None"" in the end :) Your line 13 and 14 has a syntax error. Well, coursera has this feature that will allow you to add online in-video quizzes in videos, We can't see them because our video player does not support the content. Temperature Converterï_ïçC toï_ïçK# Celsius to kelvin def c_to_k(celsius): return(str(celsius + 273)+""ïçK"") I made it clear not to use the math library on rule 3. Therefore, that's not a correct answer.And did you mean to comment on the math.roots? Start Menu -> All Programs -> Python 3.3 -> IDLE(Python GUI) You can't. only math.sqrt(25) exist as roots. Yes. What you need to use is just in the description. You need the (1/2) because that is the square roothere is another way:>>> import math >>> def hypotenuse (x,y): return (math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)>>> hypotenuse(3,5)5.830951894845301 Lectures are available in every Sunday, Assignments and exercises are available every Monday. But assignments are released bi-weekly(every 2 weeks). Yes. Because, the quizzes are made by Javascript code which cannot be used when we download it. Since our video player does not support javascript, The quiz does not show up. Can you post your code? You might have missed a parenthesis in the end like this:>>> print((2 + 3) - 5 The guys above me are right.ï_Your function must contain a name along with a parameter like this:def f(x): # Function f with a parameter named x. return x**2 No. In the 2.x version, When both integers are divided, it would result to an integer. This is another difference that 2.x and 3.x have. In the 2.x version, one of them must be a float.like so:# Python in 2.7 >>> print 5/3 1 >>> print 5/3.0 1.66666666667 I have found some resources:ï_http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120805161054AAGIiT6http://library.iated.org/view/MILANO2011USI That is 2 to the power of 5. You are using the exponentiation operator It multiplies itself to a certain value.It is used to evaluate exponentsï_like this:2**5 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 323**2 = 3*3 = 9 Error in line 10. You need to enclose it with the parenthesis as of python 3.3Or at least replace print to return I found another method:>>> import builtins >>> dir(builtins)I found it from this post:https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=255VISWANATHAN T Vï_posted it. You are not supposed to use the square brackets. It is supposed to be like this:>>> round(9.09876 , 2) 9.1 >>> pow(2, 5) 32 >>> round(9.09876) 9 >>> pow(2, 5, 10) 2The square brackets means that the parameter is optional. Your program doesn't really return the largest number, it just returns the last input.Here's the one you want:largest = eval(input('Enter a positive number: ')) list_of_num = [] for i in range(9): num = eval(input('Enter a positive number: ')) list_of_num.append(num) print(list_of_num) largest=max(list_of_num) print(""Largest number: %d"" % (largest)) This program collects a list of your inputs using the variable list_of_num and the largest variable picks the largest input and prints it out. :) It's a Syntax Error because it breaks the rules in making a variable.NameErrors apply when you assign a variable with a variable that doesn't exist.More info here:ï_http://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html Nice guidelines. This will help us ask and answer a question in the forums :) Correct! It still has the problem. Here is my attempt:http://pastebin.com/EtXxnmyi There are two possible problems:1.

And they go over it so quickly on the video, I actually had to re-watch it a couple of times before I caught it - the instructor will say the keyboard command for her OS, and the screen will display a footnote on the workspace of the instructor's IDLE window that gives alternatives for other operating systems).

Looks like the Exit function is not specified for the the given code and it can't handle when any exception arises.BTW it's my opinion,it can be wrong too :) Anyways see it for yourself if it does work. On the github page,click the '<>' view raw icon and then paste it on new IDLE window.That way,it will eliminate any uncertaion indentation error. Very simple,you should have indented the return statement away from the if construct,so that only when it would have chacked all possiblities,then it would have returned true. I myself was quite surprised when I got 23.0/24.0 and the auto-grader flashed the message, is_valid_sequence test failed. I took great pains to ensure empty strings are not accepted but then I realized that in order to humor the auto-grader,empty strings must be allowed in the code. Beats me,but removing that check from the code did the trick. Same problem here,would be a great help if anyone can point out the right direction to proceed.",0

Kenneth Horton,"When running under the PYTHON shell, it will automatically print the result of the function call, whereas under IDLE it is executing the function call only. Change the last line to read as follows, and it will display the result.print (convert_to_fahrenheit(int(input(""Enter something: "")) ))You could also assign the function call to a variable, and then print the variable.Also, you can start a new thread by clicking on the ""Start New Thread"" button which is on the page where it displays all the topics. The button is located just above the list of current topics. treats = [['apple', 'pie'], ['vanilla', 'ice-cream'], ['chocolate', 'cake']] Using treats and indexing with only negative indices, write an expression that evaluates to 'pie'. Do not use addition, subtraction, or parentheses ( ) (brackets [ ] are required).I answered this question which was marked wrong, but evaluated correctly in the Shell. I used only negative indices. All other restrictions were followed. Of course, I cannot provide the answer here. My score on this attempt would have been 100% if it had not been for this. I found the reason. When I was typing the brackets, one of them went in twice. Just was no obvious when looking at it. Would have noticed it if I had pasted it into the Shell rather than typing it over again. For information purposes only, and not to comment for or against any post above. Negative indices can be thought of as if you were shifting the index to the left from the first element, and rotating counter-clockwise through the last element. This can therefore be thought of as a pointer, and not math. I can only guess that the reason that these problems say that math should not be used is that they do not want any calculations performed such as using the len() function to in any way determine the pointer value. The idea is to teach how to access a list in this manner using only a pointer, whether it be positive or negative. The other idea here also may be to indicate the simplicity in which the element may be accessed. It may be true in some real applications that math may be required to access the desired element. One thing to remember with While loops is that any variables that are in the condition must be set before executing the While instruction the first time. If the condition is False upon the first execution, then the body of the While instruction will never be run. If it is True, then it will be run, and the the While condition will be checked again.Here is an example where you will see that you have to initialize the variable 'val'. It will enter the While loop in the first check, and the body of the While loop will be processed. It will then loop back on the While until the the condition val < 5 is true. Not that it will not enter the body of the While when val = 5. The value of five will actually be printed outside the loop.list = [1,2,3,4,5]index = 0val = list[index]while val < 5:ï_ï_ï_ print (val)ï_ï_ï_ index = index + 1ï_ï_ï_ val = list[index]print (""End loop"")print (val)Here is another example where it will never enter the body of the While loop. The initial value of val will be '5'. When val is checked on the first conditional check it will equate to False. Execution will then continue at the instruction that prints ""End Loop"".list = [1,2,3,4,5]index = len(list)-1val = list[index]while val < 5:ï_ï_ï_ print (val)ï_ï_ï_ index = index + 1ï_ï_ï_ val = list[index]print (""End loop"")print (val)",0

Thanks a lot :) I keep on getting 22/24. Finally I have figured out where the problem is. It is in the insert_sequence part. I got my code to work out exactly the asked problem.

I tried ï_ï_ï_ s = len(dna1)/2-1ï_ï_ï_ return dna1[s:] + dna2 + dna1[:s]only to be told that I can't use s, ie there must be a number in there. I have hit a wall here. I can't find the answer in the lectures at all..... Thats what I thought too. I used the midpoint based on the midpoing of AAGG and it worked. But when I submitted it, it came back with an error there. They tested it with a 8 digits and it failed then, as my midpoint was after 2 characters. I did get the example they gave and got it to work. It has 6 digits like AABBCC. I got the AT to go in the middle so it returned AABATBCC. But when they test it they used an 8 digit code like AABBCCDD and mine didn't work. So only 22 out of 24. :( Thank you all for your help. I re-read the question again. Man alive I was way off. Just uploaded my new code (which doesn't work!) and got 24/24. When I tested in Idle it says that is can't slice at index s - the index must be an integer.

Anton Jelle,"Hi I have never used python before but i am familiar with c, c++, c# and a few other programs. Im taking this cours with my Girlfriend as she would like to know some basic programming and i would like to brush up on my skills and in the process it is nice to learn a new languasge.My question or objection is the following:in your code you write (float, float) -> str. and as long as your input are in that format it will work fine.But as long as the arguments are the same type your defenition will return a string( I only tested with strings, i don't know if other types will result in an error),so you can writeï_>>> report_status('hello', 'hi')ï_and it will return a string (ï_'delayed').I can under stand why you don't want to check if the argument are the correct type, or why you don't want to consider the date of the flights, as it would just expand the code with out really clarifying anything.But you are teaching people the basics of code and you use the else to return a expected response. I think it should have been:def report_status(scheduled_time, estimated_time): """""" (float, float) -> str Return the flight status (on time, early, delayed) for a flight that was scheduled to arrive at scheduled_timed, but is now estimated to arrive at estimated_time. Pre-condition: 0.0 <= scheduled_time < 24.0 and 0.0 <= estimated_time < 24.0 >>> report_status(14.3, 14.3) 'on_time' >>> report_status(12.5, 11.5) 'early' >>> report_status(9.0, 9.5) 'delayed' """""" if scheduled_time == estimated_time: return 'on time' elif scheduled_time > estimated_time: return 'early' elif scheduled_time < estimated_time: return 'delayed'And you should have reserved, the else to a catchall or somthing like that.ï_I mean somthing like that can stick with peoplesï_way of writing code.Or is there another reason you chose to use ""else"" that i haven't considered.RegardsAntonP.S I don't know if this is in the right forumso feel free to move it to the propper. ï_:) Thank you I was thinking along those lines. But i still think it is not the propper use for else.Regards Without having run the code i would say indentation. ï_ Can you executeif 18 < temp and temp < 26: print(""A comfortable temperature"") print(""Let's go for a swim"")?I can't. It needs indentations.so both are wrong. what value should i expect to get if i runcount_nucleotides('ATCTA', '')6 or 0? So we count the ""spaces"" between chars. OK ty. I will use the methode that returns that. do you have a reason as to why you think so you have you handed your assignment in and gotten a correct for your answer?",1
Jody Broad,"Hi both,I think you need to re-read the question more carefully;ï_Your answer must be a single expression that does not use square brackets (string indexing and slicing), and you can only call methodï_str.findï_and use the arithmetic operators (+, -, etc.).Hope this helps!",1

Jin Hwan Oh,"I guess as a last resort, you could rent a KVM VPS with an Ubuntu 12.04/12.10 Desktop template and run everything through the VNC/console. That way you don't mess with anything on your company computer, though you'll have lag.DigitalOcean is pretty easy to use and really cheap, I think you'll do fine with the 512MB RAM one that costs $5/mo. or $0.007/hr.

Thomas West,"Hello,I have been thinking about this for a week now and I'm stumped, What is the programmatic structure for creating a variable that contains multiple other variables? Or perhaps I should say, a variable that references multiple other variables. For example, if I want to make a game with the player controller character (lets call him ""Hero Dude"") having the following variables:Name: Hero Dudeï_ Speed: two tiles per second Hitpoints: 10Attack: 6Armor: 2 Speed, hitpoints, attack and armor are all sub-objects of ""Hero Dude."" I need to know the programmatic structure for having one variable (Hero Dude) that contains all these other variables.ï_ I am new to programing so I may not be using the correct terminology. I do understand what a loop (for or while) is, IF then structure, i.e the general structures in programming. You may wonder why I am calling these variables. Hitpoints can't be a constant, because I plan to have items that will add to them, so for example at level 2 Hero Dude may get + 2 hitpoints, meaning that hitpoints needs to be able to change to 12 instead of being frozen at 10. The same for the other mentioned variables. The way I have seen this done in other games varies. For example, in age of empires 3, stats (i.e. health, movement, attack etc) are placed inside an xml file on a per unit basis.ï_ The format being<attack>6</attack><health>10</health> etc. At that point it must be that the game engine knows what <health> , <attack> and the other values are and how to handle them. i.e. when a unit is attacked the formula is unit receiving the attack takes attack damage of attacker unit minus unit receiving attacks armor value. However, I don't know what type of programing stuctures are on the back end to make the game understand ""hey everything in /entities/hero dude.xml refers to the abilities hero dude has."" Any examples (with or without code) would help a lot! Thank you kindly in advance for your assistance. Thank everyone!A stronger villian? Hmm well from the above code example ie.:# define character class class Character: def __init__(self, speed, hitpoints, attack, armor): self.speed = speed self.hitpoints = hitpoints self.attack = attack self.armor = armor def get_speed(self): return self.speed def get_hitpoints(self): return self.hitpoints def get_armor(self): return self.armor def add_hitpoints(self, points): self.hitpoints += points Instead ofï_ï_ hero_dude = Character(2, 10, 6, 2)ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ I could go with villian = Character(4, 12, 7, 4)ï_ and call the same class, replacing every instance of Hero_dude with villian. However, I wonder what happens if villian and hero_dude both call the same class at the same time? How is that threading handled? Does villian need his own class?ï_ I also considered adding a gaia class with no attack or armor for non player controlled animals that wander around i.e. deer, chickens.ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ For items, I can create functions that do what the item should. For example, ""sword of double attack"" could be a function which calls a certain characters attack and * 2.ï_ I know games are not easy, but my goal is to start small then move up. I like the OOP model because it seems to suit that method the best. I looked into using arrays for a characters stats, but the syntax looked quite arcane. My first goal for a game is 1 room, 1 player controlled character, 1 enemy; 2d top down view. Something like this:http://www.digitalwhip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/34385-legend_of_zelda_the_-_a_link_to_the_past...Both characters can move north, east, south, and west, and attack. game ends when 1 character health = 0 I have made mods for age of kings the conquers. I was part of a project that (over years) figured out how to edit the stats in that game. i.e. health, movement, armor. Its interesting to note where in that game engine Ensemble Studios used floats and where they used ints.ï_ Floats were used where more precise control was important; balance is key in rpgs. For example, ints are used for health. However, reload time uses the format x.xxx where 1.000 is = to 1 second. so - 0.500 from the reload time, and reload is cut in half. Or to be more precise could -0.100 from reload. The value seems small but makes a big difference when there are 100's of units on the screen. Do if statements loop or only run once? For example, if I want to call a function called game_over when a characters hitpoints = 0...if hitpoints == 0ï_ï_ return(game_over) It seems that statement would only run once. Perhaps what I actually need is some type of while loop? Something like (in pesudocode) :while hitpoints >= 1 run mainloop. ï_ elif:ï_ return(game_over) This assumes game_over is a function which ends the main game loop. Hello,I get 19 out of 24. I've looked over the failures and I think I know whats broken. However, I wonder when I can post my code to see how to make it right.

Samuel Crane,"I think it's too avoid guesswork. If you're allowed to try the quiz 5 times, you could increment your score each time with blind guessing. However, if the questions shift each try and you have to redo the problem, then guessing won't really help you out. And at the same time, if you have learned the material, then yes it's a bit more work to have to redo problems, but then again you're getting multiple opportunities to correct your mistakes. Seems like a fair compromise between giving people a fair shot and preventing cheating.ï_ Also, it should be noted, you can view your previous attempts in a separate tab while you make a new attempt.
