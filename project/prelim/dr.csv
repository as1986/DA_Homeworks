We do spend hours in groups slaving over small changes in wording (in case you thought we just slapped things together). What part of the docstring did you find confusing that the other docstring clarified (in this particular instance)? The main difference I see is that the description of the board appears in the docstring. In this instance, we wouldn't change the docstring; what constitutes a board appears at the top of the file and it would be extremely odd to repeat the same information in every single docstring that a board is referenced (also, what happens if the specification of the board changes? That's a lot of hunting through code to make a change). If the problem was that the description of a board at the top of the file did not specifically mention ""single characters"", this is something we could do to improve our docstring.As for the example, because there's file input/output involved, we don't write examples for it (as per the function design recipe).

My bad.That being said, both of you missed my point completely, so let's back track a bit. For someone who is not used to programming, we don't know what short cuts to take. We don't know what information is important and what information we can ignore. So saying, ""Don't concern yourself with how it does this"", we have to concern us. That's how we understand. You have taken this course before and did so well they asked you back. ERGO you know more than most of us. So how about talking to us in a way even beginners can understand?

Read my previous post about to_24_clock_hour and in the instructions re-read theï_Functions[...]/Descriptionï_table for get_hours function for more to_24_clock_hour info.

get_minutes: It's close. The formula between parenthesis give as result just theï_time in seconds minus 1 hour. That works just for small values. For example, 452000 seconds are 5h 33m 20s. If you try get_minutes(452000) with
your formula returns the 7473 minutes instead 33 minutes.

Using the previous example, in that part of the formula you need to know (in seconds) the minutes remaining (33min) discarding the hours (5h) that fits in that time in seconds. Read the last sentence in my previous post.

[EDIT] get_seconds: It's right.
I hope this helps.

As argument you give it a substring  contained or not in string. If the substring is found
it returns the position (index) where the substring starts. [Additional to the substring you can give it the optional parameters start and endï_to find the substring between the start indexï_or/and the end index of the
string].

For example.

s = 'rock and roll'
#    0123456789012
If you wanna know in what position starts the substring 'roll', s.find('roll') returns 9.

If you wanna know in what position starts the substring 'and' from position 2 (index), s.find('and', 2) returns 5.

Right?

To answer your questions:

1) Using twice the find function (Read the hint), your code have to find in s1 the position where s2 appears for the 2nd time:

For example:s1 = 'banana'
#     012345

s2 = 'ana'The string s2ï_'ana' appears the first time in the position 1 of s1. The 2nd time, s2 appears in the position 3 of s1.

3)
s1 = 'rock and roll'

s2 = 'o'
The string s2ï_'o'ï_appears the first time in the position 1 of s1. The 2nd time, s2 appears in the position 10 of s1.ï_I hope this help.

But, in your post about the messages from Autotester when you think that your code was right and it's not. Those are common and usually are little mistakes resolved in the forum.

About insert_sequence:

First, in your expression why you use [:] after s2, like s2[:]? s2 is equal to 'gg', so...

Second. How to do it generic? What it could change always in the function? The parameters. So, are you using all parameters in your expression?

Do you really think the effort of that guy doesnïŠt deserve that credits beacuse is not fair for the rest of students even if he worked as harder or more than others?.

I was confused by the term ""string slicing"" used in the post by Tom Enos of two days ago.

I feel that it helps me think more freely because I have the freedom to scribble anything anywhere without constraints. One can also use it to organize any variables, functions, expressions, etc... needed for solving the problem.Redundant code: If you find yourself writing code that looks like if (a == a) :return Trueelse:return FalseThen there is probably a less redundant way of writing it such asreturn a == aIf the code works, you don't have to worry about changing it until you find yourself with extra time so don't panic if you can't make code less redundant immediately!Rubber duck debugging: I love this one. Essentially, when something is wrong with your code, you have to debug it. This 'technique' is pretty much explaining out loud, to no one in particular and in terms that a child could understand, how the code is supposed to work, line by line. The idea is that as you're explaining the code you'll run into the problem code and won't be able to explain it until you fix it (presumably you can't explain code that doesn't behave how want it to.)Study other code: Whenever you can, it's best to look at other people's code and study it.

More importantly, people will submit their games and anyone can download the code and see how it works and being used!","Wednesday, September 11th 2013, 1:16 pm -04:00",1802,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1802,,Tips and Tricks,1378919806,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,1,0

""approximate"" etc, (thinkin about numbers). What the question is asking actually is:""Which English sentence is ALWAYS true when the Boolean expression evaluates to True?""That would have been a better writing. To me the adverb ""exactly"" is not the correct one in this context. ""the boolean expression evaluates to true"" can happens in many cases, and for those cases the True evaluation is always ""exactly"" true (we are talking about computers). It looks like the question is asking something as:""Which English sentence is true exactly whenever happens that the Boolean expression evaluates to True?"" ... or ""Which English sentence is true (can be true) exactly (again...true and exactly true means the same in this context) if this boolean expression evaluates to True... among all possibilities"" or ""which of these English sentences cannot be True...whenever the Boolean expression evaluates to True""Notice that the question is asking about the trueness of the English sentence, no pointins at the boolean expression. For all the possible cases it can be true that, for instance: ""the student passed all the courses"" provided that the grades are passing grades for all subjects. ""Exactly"" refers to ""without vagueness"" etc (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exactly). So, in every respect ""the student passed all the grades"", in this case is ""exactly true"".YoursLuis","Monday, September 16th 2013, 6:04 am -04:00",1401,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1401, Unresolved,Can someone help me understand the last in-video quiz of Lecture 3.2,1379325893,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=29,Type bool,0,0

First of all, don't worry guys, each coursera course explains with details how the final exam should be submitted, how much time do we have to submit it, and all the things that we need to know before doing it. I am sure this course will follow this rule.To study for the final exam I won't recommend people to watch all the video lectures again and re-do the assignments and exercises, cause that is too exhausting and nobody got time for that. What I recommend is to take a quick look on the notes of the video lectures that we most have doubts, because this is fast and can be very helpful. My last recommendation is to practice and understand the structure of the conditionals (Boolean and ifs) and the loops, cause they are the most important concepts to start programming. All the built-in functions and methods can be rapidly understood by the 'help' command, but the conditionals and loop logic are not.","Monday, September 23rd 2013, 8:20 am -04:00",1530,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1530, Resolved,How can we better prepare for final exam?,1379938857,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=66,Final Exam,7,0

    It will return 4(1+3) because all odd numbers will go into if block and even numbers will go into else block. Even though found_even is assigned true in else block, it doesn't affect the loop as there is no condition for checking found_even variable.
In code 2: 
   It will return 1 because when num = 1, the if block is executed. But if num = 2, the else block is executed and therefore found_even = true. And if num = 3, the if block doesn't execute.... That's because found_even = true and the condition not found_even means false and hence it returns 1...

Make sure you have the file name right. ""wordlist1.txt"" is not the same as ""wordslist1.txt"". I just found this myself and I think it is just a minor typo.ï_



Then, I would create a separate folder (maybe named ""Assignment3"") and have a fresh copy of a3.py, a3_driver.py, wordlist1.txt and board1.txt inside. Then open all of them in IDLE. The a3_driver.py calls read_words(words_file) with words_file already pointing to wordlist1.txt open for reading. However, if you just want to test read_words without having to run a3_driver, first run a3.py, then go to the interactive screen in idleï_To make sure the interpreter is working in the folder you just created, run the following:>>>import os>>> os.chdir(""C:\<path>\Assignment3"")for example mine is>>>import os>>> os.chdir(""C:\Projects\Learning To Program\Assignments\Assignment3"")if you want to be sure you are in the right directory run:>>>os.listdir()and it should list the four filesthen its just a matter of opening up the file for reading directly>>>tmp_words_file = open(""wordlist1.txt"",""r"")ï_and using it in your read_words() function>>>read_words(tmp_words_file)

Or perhaps I should say, a variable that references multiple other variables. For example, if I want to make a game with the player controller character (lets call him ""Hero Dude"") having the following variables:Name: Hero Dudeï_ Speed: two tiles per second Hitpoints: 10Attack: 6Armor: 2 Speed, hitpoints, attack and armor are all sub-objects of ""Hero Dude."" I need to know the programmatic structure for having one variable (Hero Dude) that contains all these other variables.ï_ I am new to programing so I may not be using the correct terminology. I do understand what a loop (for or while) is, IF then structure, i.e the general structures in programming. You may wonder why I am calling these variables. Hitpoints can't be a constant, because I plan to have items that will add to them, so for example at level 2 Hero Dude may get + 2 hitpoints, meaning that hitpoints needs to be able to change to 12 instead of being frozen at 10. The same for the other mentioned variables. The way I have seen this done in other games varies. For example, in age of empires 3, stats (i.e. health, movement, attack etc) are placed inside an xml file on a per unit basis.ï_ The format being<attack>6</attack><health>10</health> etc. At that point it must be that the game engine knows what <health> , <attack> and the other values are and how to handle them. i.e. when a unit is attacked the formula is unit receiving the attack takes attack damage of attacker unit minus unit receiving attacks armor value.

class Character:
    def __init__(self, speed, hitpoints, attack, armor):
        self.speed = speed
        self.hitpoints = hitpoints
        self.attack = attack

    def get_armor(self):
        return self.armor

    def add_hitpoints(self, points):
        self.hitpoints += points
Instead ofï_ï_ hero_dude = Character(2, 10, 6, 2)ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ I could go with villian = Character(4, 12, 7, 4)ï_ and call the same class, replacing every instance of Hero_dude with villian. However, I wonder what happens if villian and hero_dude both call the same class at the same time? How is that threading handled? Does villian need his own class?ï_ I also considered adding a gaia class with no attack or armor for non player controlled animals that wander around i.e. deer, chickens.ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ For items, I can create functions that do what the item should. For example, ""sword of double attack"" could be a function which calls a certain characters attack and * 2.ï_ I know games are not easy, but my goal is to start small then move up. I like the OOP model because it seems to suit that method the best. I looked into using arrays for a characters stats, but the syntax looked quite arcane. My first goal for a game is 1 room, 1 player controlled character, 1 enemy; 2d top down view. Something like this:http://www.digitalwhip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/34385-legend_of_zelda_the_-_a_link_to_the_past...Both characters can move north, east, south, and west, and attack. game ends when 1 character health = 0 I have made mods for age of kings the conquers. I was part of a project that (over years) figured out how to edit the stats in that game. i.e. health, movement, armor. Its interesting to note where in that game engine Ensemble Studios used floats and where they used ints.ï_ Floats were used where more precise control was important; balance is key in rpgs. For example, ints are used for health. However, reload time uses the format x.xxx where 1.000 is = to 1 second. so - 0.500 from the reload time, and reload is cut in half. Or to be more precise could -0.100 from reload. The value seems small but makes a big difference when there are 100's of units on the screen.

Also, I kinda need to thank the instructors! A few weeks ago, I was completely frustrated with the assignment for the week, so I took a break and I wrote a short story... In python script. I had long been amused by the possibilities of creative # lines. It is probably NOT proper programming protocol, but my python files are perpetually littered with asides, like:# Here comes the hard part.or# I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING # WHY AM I HERE # WHAT IS THIS MACHINEï_# HELPI've also been intrigued by how READABLE python is. As a high level programming language, a lot of simple python code can be understood or its purpose at least guessed at by a non programmer reading the text file.So, I sat down and wrote a short story, which can either be played as a very short piece of interactive hyperfiction in the Python 3 shell, OR can be read as a piece of prose fiction, alternating between a narrator monologuing in the # lines and a program written out in if/elif/else print statements.I submitted it to an online magazine, and figured if they didn't buy it, I would show it to folks on the forums....As it turns out, as of the e-mail I just received, I CANNOT show it to you in the forums. :D :D :D :DDaily Science Fiction just sent me my acceptance letter. I don't know when the story will go up, sadly. Magazines like to have a buffer of stories lined up well in advance, so it could be a good many months. But darnit, I wanted to gloat NOW, and this seemed like a good place to do it. Thanks so much to the instructors and the folks on these boards for giving me the skills I needed to write that story! ...And to the instructors again for making homework assignments mind boggling enough that I needed to throw up my hands in temporary defeat and do something else. No inspiration like frustration, as it turns out.","Monday, September 30th 2013, 5:10 am -04:00",2918,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2918,,I Wrote a Short Story in Python,1380532234,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,4,0

But your question is dependend on what you are up to. So it is wrongly phrased. There is no best language. What is best, will be dependend on your purpose. Python is not that fast, because it's an interpreter-language. Thats why many write modules in C for it. That makes it limited useful for real-time applications like professional games and anything that goes to the professional market and demands real-time behavior. It's also not that great for visual arts at the moment. I did a Processing course over the summer and that language would be much more suited and built for this purpose.- On the other hand Python is on board of most linux-distributions. - It has become very common in science because it is easy to grasp and flexible (sort of hot glue). Science for many things doesn't demand realtime. There are complex math modules like numpy.- Elegant syntax.- Good and fast for prototyping for people who then will build the programm in harder languages.- Huge community (it counts)","Wednesday, October 2nd 2013, 6:15 am -04:00",3065,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=3065,,Python is the best programming language,1380708919,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,1,0

Instead you'll be asking ""Which language is the best for the problem at hand?""Some languages are better than others at certain things.

And say you're looking to do some web stuff, in that case things like PHP become your best friend.The best advice you can be given is not to peg yourself to a language, you'll enjoy some more than others, and there'll be some that you downright hate (Visual Basic, for example :D ) But you don't use a spanner to hammer in a nail, you'll come to points where another language will be the best option and will save you a lot of heartache.Most importantly, don't think of this as learning to program in Python, instead think that you are learning to program. Really what you want to get out of this is an idea of what you can do and what the basic structures of Procedural/OO Programming are.

It's beautiful and brutal all at once.Think about it in terms of the Fibonacci sequence function.We know that each number in the Fibonacci sequence is calculated by adding the previous two numbers together. So 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...Recursion works by having a base case (In this case, fib(0) = 0 and fib(1)) and then having a well defined way to work backwards from any case to our base case.Say we call fib(3), what we're expecting to happen is this...fib(3), 3 != 1 and 3 != 0, so return the result of fib(2)+ fib(1)     fib(2), 2 != 1 and 2 != 0, so return the result of fib(1) +  fib(0)         fib(1) returns 1         Fib(0) returns 0     fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0) = 1 + 0 = 1          fib(1) returns 1fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1) = 1 + 1 = 2So the third number in the Fibonacci sequence is 2.A few things to watch out for:1. If your base case isn't right, or your working backwards isn't right, your program will crash.2. If you delve too deeply with recursion, you'll run out of memory and your program will fail.3. Usually if you can do something recursively, you can also do it iteratively (using a loop of some kind). iteratively usually ends up being a bit nicer on your memory.","Monday, September 9th 2013, 8:52 pm -04:00",1634,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1634,,Having a hard time understanding recursion,1378774339,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,1,0

,Off-topic Discussion,,,Tim Death,post-9846,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1634#post-9846,"Another simple recursive function would be finding a character in a string. For example:def findChar(s, char):   if s == '':       return False   if s[0] == char       return True   return findChar(s[1:], char)I know, I know, we could just say return char in s, but this is an example.In this case we have two different base classes:1. The string is empty, we know the character is not here.2. The first character in the string is the one that we are looking for. The character is inside the string.So say we called findChar('Average', 'r'), if we work through how this would execute, we can build a table:Call # | Current String | Is the first character 'r'? | Next statement to execute1 | Average | No | findChar('verage', 'r')2 | verage | No | findChar('erage', 'r')3 | erage | No | findChar('rage', r)4 | erage | Yes | return True Or maybe weï_ try with findChar('Tim', u):Call # | Current String | Is the first character 'r'? | Next statement to execute1 | Tim | No | findChar('im', 'u')2 | im | No | findChar('m', 'u')3 | m | No | findChar('', u)4 | '' | No | return False As you can see, the way recursion works is we use what we do know (We know that if the string is empty then the character is not in the string, and we know that if the character we want is the first character in the string to search, than it does exist in the string) in order to solve our problem by breaking down to that level. In mathematics recursion is based off saying that if you can solve a problem p for p(0), and if you can solve a problem for p(1), then you can use this to solve any problem for p(n)In regards of what gets returned, remember when we were doing things like return 1 == 1, the 1 == 1 is evaluated before it is returned, so in the example of findChar('Average', 'r'):findChar('Average', 'r'):                   ^->     findChar('verage', 'r'):             |    ->     findChar('erage', 'r'):          |        ->     findChar('rage', 'r'): True! |In this way the last called function is worked through first and the value gets passed back up through the stack.Sorry for the long windedness, as a Prolog programmer I love recursion.","Tuesday, September 10th 2013, 12:55 am -04:00",1634,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1634,,Having a hard time understanding recursion,1378788919,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,0,0

If the function instead returns 12, you can work through the steps yourself and see where there might be a bug in your code.Personally, I'd rather trace things by hand than use a debugger in all but the most extreme of examples.

This is working off my own set of test cases, and my own assignment 2 file.Size of file: 2724 bytesNumber of test cases: 50Time taken on my computer: 25ms on average.Using these numbers, let's say that everyone that enrolled in the course is submitting their assignments, we'll use the worst case here, if they all submit at the same time then we would see 168.86 Mb of data needing to be downloaded to the server on the next poll of submitted assignments (65000*2724) This would also cause the amount of testing time to be around 25*65000 milliseconds, which actually ends up being around half an hour. This is quite a simple outlook, I haven't bothered considering a parallel running of the marking. I also don't include the time needed to output the results to the webpage.Consider that everyone is submitting once every 5-10 seconds, it's quite clear that without a decent sized gap between submissions would cause an almost constant load on the server.Moving down, let's consider if only the people who submitted something for assignment 1 managed to do so for assignment two. In the announcements this is listed as 3874. so...3874*2724 = 10552776, so closer to 10 MbAnd 25*3874 = 9685, which is just over a minute.I think the original delay was created to ensure that in the worst case the number of people submitting could be handled.

So keep trying until you make it because you will get it as long as you try! But you are on the right track, I can see that on your code!Now on to your problem. You need to study the function design recipe (video 3 - 5) in order to understand what each part of the function is supposed to do. The ""return"" - statement or the Body as it's really called is supposed to execute your code.ï_So if you are making a smoothie, you might have already put all the ingredients in the mixer but you haven't pressed the button that will mix your smoothie together and that will be the final step before you have a ready to drink beverage.The same idea applies to the function design recipe, all the other lines are your ingredients, your tools which you use the function for but the return is what mixes all those ingredients into what will then become the final product.So think of what you want with your code. You want to know how many seconds different are the two times, right? How do you, outside of Python, in real life, calculate the difference between two things? Just like you have started to do, you subtract them with each other in order to get the difference.The problem with your code is the seconds_difference in that line. seconds_difference is a function and you don't need to return the actual function, you need to return the value of that function.

Some courses have helpful students who post updated versions of the captions but obviously that takes some effort and is subject to a delay. It is unfortunate for those who are not native English speakers (or are hearing impaired) and rely on the captions but manually transcribing all the lectures is an intensive task and for a free course it would be a significant overhead. As it is, the lecturers, their students and administrators, and the forum TAs all give their time with no financial reward. These MOOCs have tens of thousands of enrollees  and tailoring the course for the benefit of every individual is not feasible, so it is inevitable that some will feel dissatisfied with the product or be unable to keep up with the schedule.
I have enrolled in over a dozen courses but have not been able to keep up with all of them owing to real-world obligations. So I persist with some to get the personal satisfaction of the certificate but with others I download all the course materials to enjoy in my own time and for my own self-education.

I'm afraid that I can't offer much hope for you as the whole Coursera model is based on having an Internet connection. If you want get a certificate then you need to ensure that you complete all the exercises and assignments in good time. It is actually feasible to get the certificate of completion even if you don't do the final exam, providing that your other course work is of a high enough standard.
If you really want/need to complete the final exam then you should take whatever steps possible to ensure that you have the most reliable connection possible or have a backup strategy. So I would suggest that you only attempt the exam at a time of day when you can be relatively confident of a continuous connection, perhaps at night when others are asleep or when there is less demand on the local infrastructure. Make sure that you download and save as much as possible of the exam before attempting the questions so that you can work offline if necessary and upload when you regain a connection.  Also don't leave it until the last minute, try and plan your time well in advance. I appreciate your concerns but these courses have so many students that making exceptions for a small minority is not fair for the majority. It sounds heartless, I know, but these courses are free and tailoring them to a minority of students in special circumstances is not a practical proposition.  So I wish you good luck and hope that you manage to complete the course without any problems.

,Off-topic Discussion,,,Passoen Peigham,post-9929,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1683#post-9929,"IntroNext to
this course I_‹_m trying to learn programming with Python by writing own programs
based upon what we learn from this course and other sources. In the best case
these would be programs which could really help me out with certain activities
and everyday live. So I tried to think of a subject I could experiment with and
which could eventually provide me with a very handy program. 

This brought me to the issue of having too many passwords to be able to
remember them all, while not wanting to write them down because somebody might
find it and while not wanting to reuse the same passwords for different
applications because that would increase the risks. 
The program
The last few courses brought me to an idea. I could write a program which would
first of all try to recognize me by asking something only I could know. It
could be a password or something else. By giving that it would grant me access.
After having access I would have to call a function, different ones for
different passwords and applications. After calling the function Python will
then give me the correct password. And here comes the tricky part, I would not
want the function to just return a password as a string because that would be
very weak. I would like it to form the password by getting every letter one by one
as a substring from a large index/list of letters. The list would contain the alphabet
several times but then not in the logical order we are used to but in a random
order. The function would have to return the different letters by searching for
their index number within the list and then concatenate them with each other
and print them as a string which would be the password. 
Reasons why?
- With this code I would not have to write my passwords on a sheet of paper or
a document on my computer so nobody can find it. 
- I would have to write it in the python.py document but that would not matter
because I assume the average person from where I live does not know how to
program with python and without that knowledge they could open and read but not
understand the code. 
- Even if they would have some knowledge working with the large list would make
it very time consuming and difficult to find the letters, because it would be a
maze of many letters in a random order. 
- It would also not matter if somebody would run the program because they would
need to answer the first question.
- If there would be somebody knowledgeable enough to hack the program then it
would not matter because with or without the program he would have known enough
to hack it anyways ï_:P. 
- I could also give the program and document a misleading name and not
something like password.py.

To sum it up it would be an easy program to write, using the methods we learned
in week 1 to 4. It would make it possible for me to find password I forget and
save them in a safe way. 
Where you can help meI would like to know what you guys think about this. Critique about the method
is more than welcome. 
- Could you name certain weaknesses? 
- Could you think of a better method which would still be possible to write
with the knowledge only attained from the first 4 weeks? 

PS: I assume programs for this already exist. I know they are much better and
safer. But as I said it is not only useful but it is also a way of learning for
me and it gives a feeling of comfort to work with programs you have made
yourself.","Tuesday, September 10th 2013, 7:01 am -04:00",1683,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1683,,Write my own password retrieving program,1378810911,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,0,0

The
first one I would like to write a function which would pull the different
string, combine them and form the password and print that. And then I would
make if statements for different passwords. For example, if I would input
Coursera then a certain if statement would pull the strings for the Coursera
password, concatenate them together and print it in the Python command line.

Besides, If you want shift to be a global variable, you needn't pass it as an argument to translate().Another issue is that when shift is assigned user input in caesar(), it really is a local variable (no global declaration there), and (global) variable shift in function find_let() doesn't refer to the same variable. Addingdef caesar():ï_ï_ï_ global shiftwill fix this.Global variable caes is initialised to a list containing an empty string as its first element. The following would do just fine :caes = []With caes being defined as global, it means that function translate() appends characters to global variable caes, then returns it, which is in turn assigned to local variable caes in function caesar().alph is used in your code to test if a character is lower case alphabetic, to return its numeric index, or to return the letter corresponding to a numeric index. Now that you're more familiar with ASCII codes, you could use the ord() function to get letter codes, chr() to get letter from code, and Python's built-in string method isalpha() (as illustrated by Lakka's post below) to test if characters belong to the alphabet.Furthermore, you define variables c and d as global, and initialise them to an empty string. C is used in translate() and d in find_let() but nowhere in those functions are they declared as global, so it means that global variables c and d are practically never used.Finally, concerning your find_let() function, if you wish to make your code shorter, you can notice that you d = alph[t] assignment occurs in both parts of your conditional test. You can safely move this assignment outside of it, like this :def find_let(b):    global shift, t, ceas    if b + shift >= 26:        t = int((b + shift) % 26)    else:        t = int(b + shift)    d = alph[t]    return dHere's an update suggestion for your code (tested in IDLE).","Thursday, August 29th 2013, 7:19 am -04:00",645,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=645,,Mind Food - Extra weekly challenge #2,1377775187,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,0,0

The ""brute-force"" approach consists        in calculating sequence length for every number of the input range.        Example :        >>> Collatz_biggest_sequence(1000)        871        '''        winning_number = 2        max_length = 2                for i in range(2, n + 1):                length = Collatz_seq_length(i)                if length > max_length:                        max_length = length                        winning_number = i        return winning_numberdef Collatz_biggest_sequence2(n):        # ""I've already done that"" approach        '''(int) -> int        return the integer from range [2 .. <n>], which produces        the longest Collatz sequence. This function keeps track of already        calculated sequence lengths.

First downloadï_http://www.autohotkey.com/It's open source and free, code is even more basic than in Python (though java and strings can be used but I don't)Code is something like: {CTRLDOWN}{UP}{CTRLUP}.This is the other thing you need:http://www.free-ocr.com/Why do you need OCR Image to text recognition?ï_For two reasons: Firstly the error message might not be a text you can just select in blue. Secondly because sometimes windows move and Autohotkey does not automatically recognize that, so even if you would be able to select text if the error message doesn't pop-up as usual in the center part of the screen the code wouldn't work.So here's how to do it:- Build an .AHK script that shoots screenshots of the PC you want to monitor (you'll probably need to learn somethings like this symbol: '!' actually means ALT in Autohotkey. Ok, so then transform those screenshots into OCR by copy pasting the screenshot in the website (that must be done by the same script that took the screenshot and you'll probably need to run some tests for the ""Sleep, 5000"" code that will wait for the website to load).The final part I don't know it, it's entirely up to you. I'm pretty sure you'll need a string or if statements, that recognize if there's an error message. Maybe the easiest way to do it is to hide the Icons so that the screenshot will not see any words unless an error message pops-up.I'm not an expert programmer but I hope this workaround suits for you.","Tuesday, September 10th 2013, 6:32 pm -04:00",1684,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1684,,Share your idea and project thread.,1378852377,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,0,0

One is to enter an argument. You do that when you call the function. Instead when defining a function you replace an argument with an arbitrary value (such as word - notice the lack of quotation marks) to represent its parameters.Secondly you can't name the function in it's own body unless as a comment.if we are defining the function num_mountains, then our body cant be:ï_ ï_ return num_mountains(mountains1(num) + mountains2(num))This is because 'num_mountains' isn't yet defined (because we are currently defining it) so will create an error. mountains1(num) and mountains2(num) we assume were created previously before we defined this function.This particular exercise is nothing to do with defining the number of letters in 'hello' it's about defining a function that could tell you the number of letters in any word ('hello' included)From experience I also have to tell you that one of the most frustrating problems in getting your code wrongs can be small spelling mistakes or switched words.

However this creates a couple problems. Namely, the computer doesn't know how big a piece of data it is going to store, and this may not match up to the size of the previous data in some way.As a result Python keeps things running safely by always assigning a new memory address to all pieces of data so as to stop any errors occuring in it's own memory.By doing this id1 does become defunct for a fraction of a second. However the garbage collector regularly sweeps through the memory addresses and gets rid of any useless data which isn't attached to any variables/sections of code. So even though id1 is made momentarily useless, it will be available again as soon as the next command is executed.Realistically if you kept changing x from 1 to 2 to 3 etc. you wouldn't go from id1 to id2 to id 3 etc. you would just cycle back and forth between id1 and id2 as each is cleared after they become useless.This is based off of my rudimentary knowledge so anyone is welcome to come and correct me if I got something wrong!","Wednesday, August 28th 2013, 9:31 am -04:00",690,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=690, Unresolved,Memory address,1377696673,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=41,Visualizing Assignment Statements,4,0

(I'm not very knowledgeable about hardware but I assume we're talking RAM memory and not hard drive memory.). However the amount of memory addresses your computer can hold is probably far more than you'll ever need.That said memory addresses can be reused assuming that they have no function. For example let's assume you've assigned a value of 12 to variable number (number = 12). This means that number is now connected to memory address x1 which holds the value 12. Now let's change the value of number to 30 (number = 30). Now number is connected to the memory address x2 which holds the value 30.By doing this x1 has become useless as it isn't connected to any variable. The garbage collector (a specialist part of Python) regularly scans through the memory addresses looking for ones which have become useless, like x1, and clears them. So almost immediately after the value of number is changed, x1 becomes useless and is cleared by the garbage collector. As a result of x1 being cleared it becomes available for use again and you can assign it a new value.This is just a nifty way for Python to decrease errors in memory storage when you may have overlapping memory addresses which are to big or small for their relative stacks of data.","Saturday, August 31st 2013, 4:52 am -04:00",978,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=978, Unresolved,"can memory addresses be ""reused""?",1377939170,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=38,Variables,4,0

This is because although you have changed x, y still relates to the original value and therefore the original memory address, so id1 is still being used.In my opinion the first option is more likely. I think, but I'm not sure, that y wouldn't relate to the original x + 2, but instead will just relate to the product of the calculation (3). So id2 will = 3, not x+2.

Which you've eluded to.For me I work in a science lab and MatLab is used everyday which requires it's own coding language. I haven't used it myself yet and everyone I've talked to praise it as a magical power. What I've found is that in around 200 people, one person can code it effectively. So I thought I'd learn how coding works.I started with the codecademy tracks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) having absolutely no idea what I was doing. It was fun and I learnt a lot, especially with JavaScript, but I realised I don't really want to do much WebDev. So I've settled for trying to do things which are functional (make personalised apps, create hardware designed for my life with Raspberry Pi). Looking around at what I need for these aims I've found Java and Python. Python is the primary language used for Raspberry Pi and is a recommended beginner language as it is simple and easy to learn. It's also supposed to be similar to Java and C so should be a good starting point to learn other more advanced languages.Java is next because it is the primary basis for making Android apps.Essentially my scaffold is/was: Start learning so I can get a grasp of what the hell I'm getting myself into.Figure out what the hell I want to do.Research to find out what's needed/fits my wants.Start with the easiest language and do a few courses.Practice with first language, build a few things if possible (I'm already planning a game).Start more advanced language.Build with advanced language.???Profit.For specific constellations of programming languages? I'm not entirely sure of all of them but I have a hazy idea of a few.Web Dev: HTML and CSS are essential. Then JavaScript and PHP.Gaming production: Varies for what you're designing it for. Web games: JavaScript will do.Computer games/Video games: Really varies, but Java and C++ are probably a good start, maybe C.Computer software/programmes: For Microsoft use C#, Apple uses objective-C. Not sure about Linux.Apps: Andoird uses Java. ios uses objective-cAnalysis(Financial, Science, Marketing etc.): This gets really complicated. MatLab is the general language used for Scientific research that I know of. Although I know a few computer science labs use R to design analytical software. For finance and marketing, which requires analysis of large databases, a lot of people tend to use SQL (or MySQL - Oracles version of SQL). Realistically MatLab could probably do a lot of this stuff but it is used on expensive and specialist software, MySQL is fairly accessible and there are open-source versions of it.Another language worth a shout is Scratch. It's a new language designed in MIT for educational purposes. It's extremely basic and very visual, which makes it ideal for teaching kids how to programme. But although it looks much more basic then anything we learn here, it is still capable of designing things like games and so on.I have no idea what is best for code-breaking. But as cryptography is heavily based on mathematics and algorithms, I reckon it will be more about how good your maths is, as opposed to which languages you know.Nevertheless, do some research yourself, and when it comes to solving a problem and which specific language to use, you'll probably know once you've learnt a couple!","Tuesday, September 10th 2013, 5:20 am -04:00",565,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=565,,What's brought you here?,1378804805,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,3,0

Ok. So how is that going to work?Are you asking it to pull out specific letters from specific strings to form your password? Or is there a specific string within a string which is your password or answer?You will in the end have to create if statements which define what the answers are (if ""xxxx"" then give password etc.). and more to the point the code will have to have a way of producing the actual password (password = x from sting 1 + y from string b etc.)Maybe I'm missing the point here but will it work?Alternatives I can think is giving the file a random name which you remember (flrblwswartz or something) and encrypting the folder which it is in. Then instead of opening the file directly you could run it as a module in Python. As you know the name you can always get access. Then you continue with your other levels of security.A good encryption will be impossible to break and will stop anyone from seeing your code. From then on the only way someone can use your code is if they a: know the name of the module, b: understand how the functions work. and c: know the answers to your questions.The only other possibility is to use a bit of cryptography and instead of producing your password produce a formulaic product of your password (a simple version would be to produce every letter +2 of it's value, e.g. instead of a produce c, or instead of f produce h. You can make it far more complicated though.).Nevertheless good luck!","Tuesday, September 10th 2013, 9:12 am -04:00",1683,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1683,,Write my own password retrieving program,1378818758,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,0,0

I have a tonne of CSV files which use both so I want to normalise them so I can continue work on a bigger project. I figured with what we've learnt recently I'm finally ready to give it a go.So I'm stuck right at the beginning where I'm converting my file into a Python friendly list. Here is the code:from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfile

# Create a variable for the file

file = askopenfile()

#create some empty variables

doc = []

dox = []

data = ''

#read through the file line by line to make it a manageable list

for line in file:
    # clean any required variables for each loop
    data = ''
    dox = []
    for i in line:
        #grab individual characters and combine/separate into actual data
        #according to the separator: in a .csv file this would be the comma.
	if i != ',':
            data = data+i
	else:
            #append comma for completeness
            data = data+i
            #append piece of data to inner list
            dox.append(data)
            #clean required variable
            data = ''
    #append inner list to outer list
    doc.append(dox)
The type of input it should give is the following:[[{AACDC187-2E3E-4705-BCF3-0001C4187ADD},],[208000,],[28/06/2013 00:00,],[AL2 3HX,],[F,],[N,],[L,],[17,][,],[TENNYSON ROAD,],[,],[ST ALBANS,],[ST ALBANS,],[HERTFORDSHIRE,],[A] [rest of list]]instead what I get is that almost every item of the inner list is the entire set of data instead of a single line.I tested this by comparing each of the inner lists to each other sequentially :>>> for line in range(len(doc)):
	print(doc[line] == doc[line+1])The first half came up True, the other half Falsealthough comparison by eye shows little difference.I'm so confused as to why this is happening. can anyone help?","Sunday, September 29th 2013, 4:53 pm -04:00",2871,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2871,,Help with a project,1380488033,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,0,0

So how much larger than -24 is -1? You do this by subtraction: -1 - (-24) = 23. This can be confusing, because you're not using the absolute value of the numbers. It can help to visualize it on a number line:<-------(-24)----------------------(-1)--0----------------->-1 is 23 spaces to the right of -24, which is the answer that Python gives us.Let's try another example, with negative numbers:-30%24the largest multiple of 24 that isn't higher than -30 is -48, so we can subtract -48 from -30 and that gives us 18to look on a number line, -30 is 18 spaces to the right of -48 so the answer is 18.<------(-48)--------------------(-30)----------------->Using this method of calculation, the Modulo function in Python will always return a positive integer between 0 and B-1","Tuesday, September 3rd 2013, 3:22 am -04:00",1256,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1256, Unresolved,why the remainder of -1%24 is 23?,1378192928,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=18,Assignment 1,6,0

Negative indices can be thought of as if you were shifting the index to the left from the first element, and rotating counter-clockwise through the last element. This can therefore be thought of as a pointer, and not math. I can only guess that the reason that these problems say that math should not be used is that they do not want any calculations performed such as using the len() function to in any way determine the pointer value. The idea is to teach how to access a list in this manner using only a pointer, whether it be positive or negative. The other idea here also may be to indicate the simplicity in which the element may be accessed. It may be true in some real applications that math may be required to access the desired element.","Tuesday, September 24th 2013, 11:42 am -04:00",2452,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2452, Resolved,"Answer marked wrong, but evaluates correctly in Shell",1380037345,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=10107,Question 7 discussion,0,0

When someone define a function that does some job, donïŠt repeat that code in some other place, just call the function. In this case they provide two functions, count_vowels and count_consonants. Using this two functions you must write one statements that returns the number of letters of the word.Apparently, in this case using the functions provided or the built-in function len seems to be the same, but in another scenario, for example, count_letters_in_a_var_name it could be not the same.If you want to count 'letters' in this case, the function len could not be appropiated, try this:>>>ï_len(""ab4t5"")Check the response and compare with the number of letters in the 'word' (just 3).

I am not that young. I am 30. I am actually doing my PhD in Molecular Biology, but all I do there is physical work. There is no real thought process involved, let alone use of imagination. I am not very satisfied with my work. I have always been fond of Math and Physics(wanted to study them since school), but due to circumstances I chose to do Medicine and continuing now with a PhD. I am in a transition stage right now. I started studying Math on my own and attending few online courses as well. Hence my question about programming and Math, as I am relatively new to this area. I am actually finding myself more and more involved. I might as well discontinue my PhD and start full time with Math and Physics. I haven't made the decision and I am doing all this on my free-time. I just finished revising all my school Math and going to start with University level Math.ï_In this whole thread, I seem to find that I actually cannot use programming as the only tool to study Math and Physics, rather there are some places, where I can use the power of programming to execute my problems in a much efficient way. For example, in the coursera course: Introductory Physics, we used python to understand Newton's 2nd law, it was way better than doing all of that using paper and pen. Hence I opted for this course in programming. Now I am trying to figure out to what extent programming can actually help me understand Math and Physics.ï_I observe that to have a conceptual understanding of Math and Physics, I must study them as they are.ï_To state a real example, I actually understood boolean logical operators('and' 'or' 'if statements', which I am studying in Intro to Math thinking) better after joining this course.ï_ï_Hence I was wondering if programming could actually help me learn Math and what are the ways that I could use programming to learn Math.
