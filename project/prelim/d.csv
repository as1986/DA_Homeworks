Because of this, for example from my point of view, managers instead of hiring specific people for specific projects that require certain language, they opt to make the current programmers learn python and just add the extension for the required project.For example, you would need some .net developers, to programm in C#, but if your current programmers know python, you can add IronPython, which is an extension that lets you use .Net libraries, but you program in Python.Other extension is PyPy or CPython, or Jython (made in java, uses java virtual machine but you program in Python, which is faster and clearer code) or Django framework for web applications. The idea is that Python code is smaller, and has a clear syntax. An elegant way to code.http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6964392/speed-comparison-with-project-euler-c-vs-python-vs-erlang-vs-haskell Since Java 7, Oracle implemented support for dynamic languages in their Java virtual machine since 2011, and Python is a dynamic language, so you can understand that it is important.Ô_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine Python is the language that is used in scientific research, being a the researcher's programming language (combine with R language), if you are into scientific computing or something like this. It is easy to learn, flexible, clear.Python can be your first language to learn, and it's one of the most important languages to know. Other important languages are: C, C++, Java, Haskell, Perl, JavaScript, C#.In school, you are thought, in this order (usually): C -> C++ -> JavaThis covers the base to learn other languages from above.C# resembles Java, so you know most of it alreadyJavaScript resembles C syntax, and you learn about functions tooHaskell is pure functional language, i understand if you learn how to program in haskell, it will make you a better programmer, but also some ppl get frustrated when they go back to their job programming language, that is a mainstream one, and you write more lines of code with it :pÔ_http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8 http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Why_Haskell_mattersI added some links along the way, hope it helped everyone that is about to read my comment :)","Tuesday, August 27th 2013, 2:42 pm -04:00",720,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=720,,Best programming language,1377628963,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=35,Getting Started: Installing Python,12,1

Since I have a background in biology, when I read the description of the get_complementary_sequence function, I immediately thought of this as finding the reverse complement of a sequence. And it seemed to be true, because the auto-grader used the sequence 'GCTAGCTA' and expected it to return 'TAGCTAGC'. Like the name implies, first you take the complement of 'GCTAGCTA' (which is 'CGATCGAT') then reverse it to get 'TAGCTAGC'.So I was kind of confused when I saw that the example given in the handout stated that if we call this function with 'AT' as the argument, it returns 'TA'. However, using the same rule for the longer sequence, should not the function return 'AT' instead of 'TA'? Otherwise it is just returning the complement of 'AT'.","Friday, September 13th 2013, 2:05 pm -04:00",1946,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1946, Resolved,Assignment 2: question regarding the handout example for get_complementary_sequence,1379095516,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=19,Assignment 2,0,1

Is it actually possible to do this course without buying the book?? I feel I miss certain information that every time makes me have to reread everything we have already done to try and find some bit of terminology, to actually understand it. In this bit it is very simply the term ""return statement"". I trip and do not understand why we get type errors, because I do not grasp what exactly is a return statement. I must have missed it. that is the tricky bit with this course I guess. It is so logical, that when you see it you can follow it. Then life gets in the way and you don't look at it for a week and when you continue where you left of, nothing seems to make sense as the terminology doesn't seem to make sense and I feel like I have to start from the beginning to be able to understand it. It takes so long to get back in to it that I run out of time to finish what needs to be done before life gets in the way again grrr! Anyway, is there any brave person who would like to attempt to explain ""return statement "" to me or who can point me at the chapter it was explained in (not in the book as I haven't got it).

So, for instance, characters like "" have inherent value (starting and stopping strings) and when you want to use them inside a string, the way to override that and use the, so-to-speak, second interpretation (as just a character in a string) is to put  before it. Same thing with the newline character -- n's primary interpretation in a string is as a letter, so to override that and tell the code to use its secondary interpretation (as a newline signifier), that requires a  in front as well. That's probably not the best explanation, but maybe it helps, and I'm sure there are others on here who could give a more concise explanation.","Monday, September 2nd 2013, 11:04 pm -04:00",1235,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1235, Resolved,Definition of escape function,1378177469,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=42,Type str,2,1

That's good, because it helps you to jump in and get some real work done quickly and it gives you enjoy to work with that you can gain a feel for what's going on through trial and error.A Computer Science approach tends to focus more on trying to get you to understand WHY the computer responds in certain ways so that you have a deeper understanding of its behavior, but it's slower to move you forward on what you can actually do. If you aspire to eventually do things where getting all the details right is profoundly important (like messing around with programming operating systems or cryptography) understanding all the details is a big deal. If you're just looking to gain access to some functional tools and you have room for error in your projects, you don't necessarily need that kind of depth,(I also suspect that they could stand to flesh out some topics like stack frames and why they're using the virtualizer more. I think I know what they're trying to do, but I feel like they're not communicating it as clearly as they could be.)","Monday, September 16th 2013, 4:59 am -04:00",2123,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2123,,"you know what, nevermind.",1379321980,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,8,1

This means that, in your code, only the first letter of the string will ever be examined. Try 'hello' as an input and you will see that it incorrectly returns False.First, you want to have a single return statement outside of the for loop (so lined up with the for statement). Remove the returns under the ifs.Next, the way that the function is designed, it assumes that there is no vowel (see the vowel_found = False before the for loop) until it finds a vowel (at which point we want to set vowel_found to True). Once we find a vowel, we don't ever want to forget that fact, so we should never set vowel_found back to False.At the end of the for loop, if we found a vowel, vowel_found should be True. If we didn't find a vowel, vowel_found should still be False (from the initializer before the loop). Either way, once the loop is over, we have our answer, so we return it.Does this help?","Tuesday, September 17th 2013, 10:31 pm -04:00",1614,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1614, Unresolved,for loop over str: has_vowel() does not return accumulator,1379471518,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=50,for loop over str,2,1

You can resize the windows by grabbing the edges of it and moving it to where you need it. If you resize the shell and the editor to both be about half the size of your screen, then you can place them side by side. If you have the windows maximised (which means you won't be able to grab the edges) then just double click in the title bar at the top to minimise them so you can grab the edges.Hope that helps!","Sunday, September 15th 2013, 4:23 am -04:00",1027,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1027," Pinned, Resolved",Assignments: how to read the feedback.,1379233431,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=18,Assignment 1,0,1

As a simplified explanation, there is a mapping of numbers to characters. One example of this is ASCII (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters). The ord() function allows us to ask Python what number is associated with a character.  There is a reciprocal function called chr() that takes a number and gives us a character.
For example:
>>> ord('A')
65
>>> chr(65)
'A'

Using round() doesn't necessarily solve the problem depending on how and when it is used. The Python tutorial mentions using round() for post-rounding. As I mentioned in another thread, understanding the binary representation of numbers is not really important for this course. It's good to understand that this problem exists and to know that it can result in subtle errors.

I have no idea why you would ever want such a long variable name.  The length is dependant on the memory available to Python. For practical programming purposes you don't need to worry about the length of your variable names in Python.  Pick something that is descriptive but keep it reasonable as you may end up typing it a lot ;-)
As for the maximum storage size, again that is dependant on the environment. In simple terms, Python's memory limits are determined by how much physical ram and virtual memory disk space your computer and operating system have available. You certainly shouldn't be bumping in to any of these limitations during this course.

My personal recommendation is that you stick to learning the basics of programming first.  Once you're up and running and need the ability to keep track of changes that you're making to code you're writing or you need to maintain different versions of the code, that would be a good time to explore tools like git.
Having said that, if you feel you're up for the challenge, you could easily locate a git tutorial on the Internet and give it a go.  If you do decide to make use of a public site like GitHub (as opposed to creating a local git repository on your computer) be sure to look at the permissions.

Most Linux platforms I have used in the past have provided access to recent versions of Python so perhaps it is a matter of finding Python 3 in your package manager?  That's where I would start.

We are given the hours, minutes and seconds and we need to somehow combine them. What do we know? We are given the number of hours so we just have to add the minutes and seconds to that number. There is a precondition that tells us the minutes will be less than 60 so never making more hours, and seconds will always be less than 60 so never making more minutes. All of this means that we already know the number of hours we just have to figure out how to deal with the fractions (or parts of the hour).
What do we know about time? We know that 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour. A quarter (1/4) in float is 0.25. That looks a lot like the first example. If we want a quarter of an hour, perhaps we could express it as something like 15/60 (60 minutes in an hour)?
You can apply the same thinking to seconds.
To get your final result, you want to think about what mathematical operator allows your to add your results together.

When I first looked at the result of the assertions from the autograder I assumed that the result from the function being tested was on the left hand side and the expected value on the right. I had omitted the to_24_hour_clock() call for get_hours() in my initial test run; later I updated my local copy of the code but forgot to submit it to the grader.  So I thought the grader was expecting 105 instead of 9.  Hope that makes sense and I apologise for any confusion I created.
In summary - make sure you remember to call to_24_hour_clock() as per the assignment. ;-)

You need to write each of the three functions. They are independent. I would also recommend trying some other tests, like say less than an hour, one minute and just less than one minute and perhaps also something larger like more than 24 hours. Use these tests for each function.

Notice Ô_below that the space between 60 and 1 is equivalent to string index zero. If each second was an int and each millisecond was the numbers after a floating decimal point, You might see a float like 0.5 or 0.8 before the second hand reached 1. This is because computers always count up from zero.(the only true language of a computer is 0 and 1, you know this as the Ô_2-base or binary system which always starts in the off position or 0. )Ô_ Right click and select 'open image in new tab' to enlarge.As you can see here, range1 contains the spaces associated with indexes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, & 14, but, when referring to how may seconds have passed we don't say 14 seconds have passed. After all, the second hand is on the 15! This is because we don't usually think of that first second on the clock as the zero second. The convention in the industry, in an effort to stay true to computer logic, is to always remember that zero comes before 1 in any sequence. Ok, so that explains why we start with zero. But why use an extra number on the end if 0 through 14 is a total of 15 digits? Why not say just 0:14 to represent this range? Well, we are used to the way it looks on a clock. We are used to 1 being the starting number in a sequence. For our convenience, we refer to the range in programming language with overlapping numbers so we don't loose our place in the sequence. Thus, ranges Ô_with index 0 through 14 is referred to as 0 through 15, ranges with index 15 through 29 is referred to as 15 through 30, etc. In a clock with a minute hand we would say, 15 minutes past or 10 minutes till. It is no different with slicing strings. When programming we choose a range of integers that represents the part of the string we want. If we wanted the next range in the string, say Ô_indexes 15 through 29 like in range2 above, we say [15:30]. The numbers may overlap with range1 being [0:15] and range3 being [30:45]. The computer has been told by the language designers (i.e. Python designers) that this last number is purely a reference to the range we want. Thus, we can use the following equation without an overlap error:>>>clock_time = c[0:15] + c[15:30] + c[30:45] + c[45:](where c is a string represented by all the seconds on a second only clock)Note: We still start with zero while writing programs so the computer knows what index to start with.Ô_","Tuesday, September 10th 2013, 6:40 pm -04:00",1663,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1663, Resolved,Why does Python make slicing more complicated than it should by making ending index exclusive?,1378852841,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=48,str: indexing and slicing,1,1

This is because of the binary system always starting with 0 in any number sequence*. The computer sets the first index as 0 then proceeds to index the rest of the string chronologically from there. Then, to index the string with the negative integers, it uses the following formula to determine the new starting index:Ô_-(len(s[:]))Ô_The sequence starts at the total negated number of units which are in the string then it continues to index the rest of the string chronologically until it runs out of string units, which always ends with -1. (besides, there is no such thing as negative zero. ;)Ô_Remember however, that zero is only used to refer to the first positive index position._____________________________________________________________*As you may know, binary (as a 2-base numbering system) has 2 digits 0 and 1. 0 is translated as off and 1 translates as on. Before you start your computer, your computer is 'off.' When you start it, the computer first hears only one command. ""1"" or ""on"". That command of course then is the catalyst to several sets of instructions. The computer knows what order to run these programs because they are chronologically organized using binary numbers such as 0, 1, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, etc. As you can see, zero is extremely important for the computer to be able to function. Zero is it's starting point in any program sequence.

You have shown me a great teaching example of how similar syntax can really be confusing. Thanks!

for nucleotide in dna:
Combined with a for loop in extracts characters one by one and stores them in the variable nucleotide. These is no test in the for loop syntax. Your code increments each loop no matter what.
'a' in 'abc'
Combined with two strings it checks if the left string is in the right string.
Hope that helps you out!
