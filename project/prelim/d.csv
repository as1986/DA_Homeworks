Linda,

What
you include in the return statement is the expression that you want to return.

For
example, let's make a function called ""area"" which takes base
length and height and heightÔ_of a triangularÔ_and returns the area

Here's
the code:def area(base_length, height):
    return base_length * height /2
And here's an example of running this code>>> area(5,6)15.0In the example that you gave, the function takes a name of a city and returns the temperature. So the return statements should include the expression that gives the temperature. You don't need to include the parameters or any information that isn't needed for the calculation. For example, in theÔ_is_passing_grade that you asked about the return statement is 'pass' or 'fail' because that's what we need to return and it doesn't include the grade.I hope that helped...","Wednesday, August 28th 2013, 12:58 pm -04:00",764,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=764, Resolved,Return Statements,1377709126,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=45,Function Design Recipe,0,1

You can resize the windows by grabbing the edges of it and moving it to where you need it. If you resize the shell and the editor to both be about half the size of your screen, then you can place them side by side.

If n is not 0 or 1, then fib is just called again with a different value for n. HOW does this computes any kind of value? Another problem I don't quite understand is this one...The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that dividesboth of them with no remainder. One way to ‚‘Ånd the GCD of two numbers is Euclid_ã_s algorithm, which is based on the observation that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). As a base case, we canuse gcd(a, 0) = a.Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their greatest common divisor.I was able to solve the problem with:def gcd(a,b):Ô_Ô_Ô_ if b == 0:Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_ return aÔ_Ô_Ô_ elif a % b == 0:Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_ return bÔ_Ô_Ô_ remainder = a % bÔ_Ô_Ô_ return gcd(b, remainder)This seems to work fine, but I don't understand why.

When you divide 100/3, you get 33, 333333... Now, you need to understand that if you want to apply this ""infinite"" floating number to something that is either practical or quantifiable you need to round the number in order to do that. Note that when you divide 1 by 3 (0.3) and then you multiply this result by three, you should have the initial unit, but you don't, you now get 0.9 and not 1. The way to solve this is by rounding by the decimal points.I'm sorry to disagree with my friends above, they are right on their explanation but, on my point of view, this is not an error.

You are just trying to write a return statement that returns a value that matches your type contract. In your example above you are trying to call the function within the function you are defining. Simply return the value of the math you are doing. Once you do that Save the file and hit f5 or Run->Run Module from the menu. This will then run your ""a1.py"" file and load in functions you are working on.You can then CALL the function you just made. The examples above are meant to be used at this point not as an example of what the body of the function should be. Just think of it this way... when something has the three >>> arrows that means you are RUNNING / USING your functions, whereas, when you are editing things in the a1.py you are DEFINING the functions so they can be RUN / CALLED from the python shell.Hope this helps connect the dots.

First of all, calm down. Im over 7 years experienced programmer and I had had a lot of problems like this.My first advice is (and you know it): read carefully. REALLY carefully. Then try to not get angry with it. Im here too because I dont understand it.Well, the problem, just like the other mate points out, is RECURSION. He explained it well. Recursion is like asking oneself for the same task until is done. You dont need it know, ok?Second advice and a little history of myself. When you really dont get it, you paste and re-paste code and re-work, ITS TIME to clean up, just start again. Follow the Fuction Design Recipe and do it slow, remember that you are a begginer.One day I was on a great deadline with an AVL tree(advanced topic) and I just dont get it. At 3 AM, tired as hell, I deleted all my code and start again. Slowly, I maked it 2 hours late on the first try.Calm down and it would Ô_go fine.Now the problem:You need the difference between time2 and time1 right? So what is that? What is the difference between something and something? its - right?What about time2 - time1? Try to return it.Then save you file(you are working on a1.py right?) and press F5 to run it.The IDLE shell is going to say ""Restart"" and then you can type ""seconds_difference(1800.0, 3600.0)"".

your function should return 3 , instead it is returning 63.333333333333336
lets see some examples here:
lets take an input of 300 seconds
Ô_ 300 seconds , 300//60 = 5 minutes
lets take another example of 3660 seconds,
here in 3660 seconds, we will have 61 minutes ( 61*60 = 3660 seconds)
but in the
description page , description about get_minutes functions is given as:
The parameter is a number of seconds since midnight. Return the number of minutes
 that have elapsed since midnight as seen on a clock. (This means that 
the return value should be in the range 0 to 59, inclusive.)
so, my 61 minutes should read as 61-60 = 1 not 61 as 61 minutes will be displayed as 1 hour ( 60 minutes) and 1 min on the clock.","Tuesday, August 27th 2013, 6:24 pm -04:00",734,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=734, Unresolved,I MUST BE MISSING SOMETHING,1377642289,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=18,Assignment 1,1,1

Additional Exercise for your Mind
Preface
You need to use Python 3 for this exercise. python 2 is not recommended.
Required Preparation
In order to complete this assignment, you'll probably need to have watched all the week 2 videos and also done the week 2 exercise. However, you can get a good start understanding the assignment. Understanding what a program should do almost always takes
    a significant amount of time, possibly as much as an hour or two.
Problem Domain: Joe's Vacation Trip!
We have a little friend Joe and he came to our city on a vacation.
he wants to see places in our city and so we ( us) went to nearby tourist center and surprised to see the tourist center full of Systems, running python scripts and no humans [ little exaggeration eh :P] .

A robot came to us, enquired and took us to a portal where the portal asked us how many places Joe want to see?
    

Joe replied four and selected the places place1, place2, place3 and place4.
    

Joe wanted to see the place1 first and place4 last and so the portal presented two functions time_to_go() and next_place() and We should help Joe to determine how much it will take him to complete his tour.
What to do
you have two functions (given below) available to you :Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_Ô_ time_to_go(place) and next_place(place)
    

the functions are given in the script here.Exercise Script 
    

you can see the functions purpose by loading the the Exercise Script given above and running help function on them .
    


    Now that you have two functions already made for you, you should create a function called trip_time() that takes no arguments and returns the time taken by our friend 'Joe' to visit four places place1, place2, place3 and place4.
    

trip_time() should return the time in hours:minutes:seconds format to complete four places place1, place2, place3 and place4.
you should first start with the place1 and end with place4.
    

time_to_go() will return the time in minutes ( little difficult to calculate seconds for you ! )
    

even though we are working with floats the time format should consist of only ints example:
    

if it took Joe 4 hours 32 minutes and 56 seconds then round_trip() should return 4:32:56 not 4.0:32.0:56.0
    

 Little Pre-requisite Help 
You could use two functions which i feel worth to explain here: there is a function called int()
excerpt from help(int) is given below:
int(x[, base]) -> integer
Convert a string or number to an integer, if possible. A floating point argument will be truncated towards zero (this does not include a string representation of a floating point number!) When converting a string, use the optional base. It is an error
to supply a base when converting a non-string.

examples of using int function are given below:
>>> int(12.23)12>>> int(12/3)4>>> int('124')124
there is another function called round()
help(round) returns following:
round(number[, ndigits]) -> number

Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits (default 0 digits). This returns an int when called with one argument, otherwise the same type as the number. ndigits may be negative.

examples of using round function are given below:
>>> round(23.234)23>>> round(23.2434,2)23.24>>> round(324/132,2)2.45

 Caution 

    You should not use print() function anywhere.
    You should Return the value in h:mm:ss format ( without any spaces)Ô_ only.
    You should use both the functions ( time_to_go(place) and next_place(place) ) at least once in your code even though you feel they are useless. ( the function next_place here is really useless but can't help it ).

The trick is that we have to learn how Python works, not the way we'd like it to work. As said in the lecture, Python stores a reference to a memory address where a value is stored. If you look closer when x = 2gets re-assigned to x = 6you'll notice that the object 'int 2' (on the right-most column) disappears. The int 6 doesn't take its place in the same memory address, but is stored in a new memory address to which x now points to. The 'int 2' is simply gone (it's probably still in the same memory address, but nothing points to it). It's one of the main rules of Python I learned: you can't change an int in place (in the same memory address).

Sounds like IDLE has corrupted preferences. I'm not at my Mac right now. First make sure idle is not open or just 'stuck'. In the finder click on the Go menu (I think that's what it's called), hold down the option key and you'll see a Library item appear in the menu. Click it and then inside it open the Preferences folder. Look in there you should have an IDLE folder or files with IDLE or python in their name. Trash them and try opening IDLE again.
Alternatively Shift+Command+G in the finder opens a go to... Window. Type in ~/Library/Preferences should take you to the same folder.

Since I have a background in biology, when I read the description of the get_complementary_sequence function, I immediately thought of this as finding the reverse complement of a sequence. And it seemed to be true, because the auto-grader used the sequence 'GCTAGCTA' and expected it to return 'TAGCTAGC'. Like the name implies, first you take the complement of 'GCTAGCTA' (which is 'CGATCGAT') then reverse it to get 'TAGCTAGC'.So I was kind of confused when I saw that the example given in the handout stated that if we call this function with 'AT' as the argument, it returns 'TA'. However, using the same rule for the longer sequence, should not the function return 'AT' instead of 'TA'? Otherwise it is just returning the complement of 'AT'.","Friday, September 13th 2013, 2:05 pm -04:00",1946,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1946, Resolved,Assignment 2: question regarding the handout example for get_complementary_sequence,1379095516,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=19,Assignment 2,0,1

Ô_Also, make sure you are using the ""correct"" division for float.step 5: They want 3 things. Ô_get_hours, get_minutes, get_seconds. Ô_All three functions wants us to return the amount of time that has a parameter of seconds. Ô_It wants us to convert the seconds to hours since midnight. Ô_Lets look at the first one, get_hours:We know that there is 3600 seconds in 1 hour. Ô_How do we convert seconds to hours? Ô_You need to divide some numbers together to get the converted amount in hours. Ô_Next, we have a already completed function:Ô_to_24_hour_clock(hours), that takes in the time in hours (hint hint). Ô_Something will just need to be inputted into that parameter to get the correct result.Now for get_minutes: it is similiar to the problem above, but it only wants the minutes portion of the time. Ô_For example, 4,007 seconds is 1 hour, 6 minutes, 47 seconds. get_minutes will return the minutes portion which is 6 minutes (reference: Allan Orrick).get_seconds is similiar to get_minutes, except it wants the seconds portion of the time. Ô_you will need to take the number in seconds, and do a very special division. Ô_Look at to_24_hour_clock function works. Ô_Then look at how many minutes are in 1 hour.for the last 2 functions:time_from_utc(utc_offset, time):it is asking:Ô_Return time at UTC+0, where utc_offset is the number of hours away fromÔ_UTC+0.Basically this means that they want the DIFFERENCE in time between between the offset from UTC 0. Ô_I think of it like this. Ô_Lets pretend we live in the middle of the world, and our time is set where everything starts. Ô_Our time zone is at 0. Ô_It never changes. Ô_Everyone else time zone is derived from us. Ô_Japan is 2 hours ahead from us. Ô_If it is currently 11:00 at our time zone, japan must be 13:00 their time. Ô_How much time has passed between us?The second function:time_from_utc(utc_offset, time). Ô_It says:Ô_The first parameter is a UTC offset specifying a time zone and the second parameter is a time in time zone UTC+0. Return the equivalent time in the time zone specified byÔ_utc_offset.Ô_Using the example above. Ô_Japan is +2 hours ahead of us. Ô_and we are 14:00 time. Ô_What should the time in japan be?Hopefully this will help you. Ô_Please keep trying!","Tuesday, September 3rd 2013, 11:07 pm -04:00",1323,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1323, Unresolved,Frustrated with Assignment 1,1378264040,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=18,Assignment 1,8,1

Ô_For example:>>> myNumers = myFunction(100, 200)in that example, the function will kick off, returning a value of 300, and assigns 300 to myNumbers variable.Also note, in python, indentation is important.

Brozgal,post-12762,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2211#post-12762,"So I thought I'd post this on the off chance that it's helpful to someone else who's just starting out with this course using Linux Mint (or similar Linux Build). With the newest Linux Mint version, ""Olivia"" 15 KDE, IDLE is an independent install through the Software Manager. However, the version you get through the Software Manager runs on the default version of Python, which at the moment is 2.7.4. So you'd be running a 2.x shell instead of a 3.x.So the simplest solution here is opening the Konsole (terminal) and typing the following (don't bother typing the bold stuff. It's just what Konsole shows):USER@COMPUTER:~ > sudo apt-get install idle3Hit enter and it will ask you for the admin password for the system and then another enter will run it. Konsole will pull down the necessary information and then ask you to approve installation of any dependencies (other programs IDLE 3 needs). You'll get a [Y/n]? statement. Enter Y and enter again. It will finish installing on its own after that point and will eventually show the USER@COMPUTER:~ > line again. You'll be able to find the program under Applications > Development > IDLE 3 in the main menu.As a side note, these steps might be different for people on different versions of Linux. I haven't used many of them personally. Just Mint. If it doesn't work for you, I'd look up to see what install command your Linux build will accept.Anyway. Just thought that might help one or two people. Good luck. :D","Tuesday, September 17th 2013, 11:08 pm -04:00",2211,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2211,,Making IDLE run Python 3.x instead of 2.x in Linux,1379473721,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=35,Getting Started: Installing Python,0,1

I am taking this online course not only for the certificate of completion, but rather for my own understanding of computer programming. I have some experience programming in Visual Basic 2010 as well as C++, but the more complex topics of computer programming have eluded me thus far and this is what I hope to achieve here. What I would like to do is create applications for use on the Android/iOS operating systems and maybe earn a living from it, but my ultimate goal is to create an SDK or IDE for use in creating video games on current and older consoles. I wish everyone the best of luck and look forward to speaking with many of you in the hopes of gaining a deeper understanding of programming.","Sunday, August 18th 2013, 10:15 pm -04:00",24,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=24,,Where are you located and what do you expect from this course ??,1376878521,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,4,1

Ô_Looking at the to_24_hour_clock(hours), we can see that it takes only one parameter and that is 'hours'. Ô_And when we look further at the starter code given for this problem, the type contract for to_24_hour_clock(hours) is a number. So, the suggestion given by Matthew for the problem I asked earlier involves a conversion from seconds to hours inside the brackets (seconds_past_midnight//3600)... Ô_It's like, we are using three things or type contracts inside the bracket: a number(seconds), an operator(//) and a number (3600). Ô_So, isn't it against the rules of Python, though it runs the code fine? Ô_Or are these three things equivalent to a number i.e. the type contract?","Monday, September 9th 2013, 11:04 am -04:00",1504,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1504, Unresolved,Assignment 1 error,1378739072,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=18,Assignment 1,0,1
