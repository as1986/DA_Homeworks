Since I have a background in biology, when I read the description of the get_complementary_sequence function, I immediately thought of this as finding the reverse complement of a sequence. And it seemed to be true, because the auto-grader used the sequence 'GCTAGCTA' and expected it to return 'TAGCTAGC'. Like the name implies, first you take the complement of 'GCTAGCTA' (which is 'CGATCGAT') then reverse it to get 'TAGCTAGC'.So I was kind of confused when I saw that the example given in the handout stated that if we call this function with 'AT' as the argument, it returns 'TA'. However, using the same rule for the longer sequence, should not the function return 'AT' instead of 'TA'? Otherwise it is just returning the complement of 'AT'.","Friday, September 13th 2013, 2:05 pm -04:00",1946,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1946, Resolved,Assignment 2: question regarding the handout example for get_complementary_sequence,1379095516,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=19,Assignment 2,0,1

There're a lot of advices to do this in Python using an id function. Well, let's try:

>>> x = 1>>> print(x)1>>> print(hex(id(x)))0x1e279650>>> x = 2>>> print(2)2>>> print(hex(id(x)))0x1e279660But... two adresses of the same variable

and do the average. This is what I tried.

>>> def average (a, b, c, d):Ô_ Ô_ Ô_ Ô_return ( max (a, b, c, d) + I donÔät know how to continue ) / 2


IÔäm using a, b, c, d, e because I donÔät know a priori which number is the highest, so the computer has to do it for me, I saw you can write ""if"" and ""not"", but, how to use this commands? xD This was the reason why I said I should start with something
easier.

Im taking this cours with my Girlfriend as she would like to know some basic programming and i would like to brush up on my skills and in the process it is nice to learn a new languasge.My question or objection is the following:in your code you write (float, float) -> str. and as long as your input are in that format it will work fine.But as long as the arguments are the same type your defenition will return a string( I only tested with strings, i don't know if other types will result in an error),so you can writeÔ_>>> report_status('hello', 'hi')Ô_and it will return a string (Ô_'delayed').I can under stand why you don't want to check if the argument are the correct type, or why you don't want to consider the date of the flights, as it would just expand the code with out really clarifying anything.But you are teaching people the basics of code and you use the else to return a expected response. I think it should have been:def report_status(scheduled_time, estimated_time):
    """""" (float, float) -> str

    Return the flight status (on time, early, delayed) for a flight that was
    scheduled to arrive at scheduled_timed, but is now estimated to arrive
    at estimated_time.

    Pre-condition: 0.0 <= scheduled_time < 24.0 and 0.0 <= estimated_time < 24.0

    >>> report_status(14.3, 14.3)
    'on_time'

    elif scheduled_time > estimated_time:

If you're allowed to try the quiz 5 times, you could increment your score each time with blind guessing. However, if the questions shift each try and you have to redo the problem, then guessing won't really help you out. And at the same time, if you have learned the material, then yes it's a bit more work to have to redo problems, but then again you're getting multiple opportunities to correct your mistakes.
