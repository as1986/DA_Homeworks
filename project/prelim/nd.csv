                                        Hi all,

We have decided to relax the submission delay: you can now submit 
assignments as often as you like.  However, if the load on the server 
ends up slowing it down significantly, we may add a delay.

Cheers,

Or perhaps I should say, a variable that references multiple other variables. For example, if I want to make a game with the player controller character (lets call him ""Hero Dude"") having the following variables:Name: Hero Dudeï_ Speed: two tiles per second Hitpoints: 10Attack: 6Armor: 2 Speed, hitpoints, attack and armor are all sub-objects of ""Hero Dude."" I need to know the programmatic structure for having one variable (Hero Dude) that contains all these other variables.ï_ I am new to programing so I may not be using the correct terminology. I do understand what a loop (for or while) is, IF then structure, i.e the general structures in programming. You may wonder why I am calling these variables. Hitpoints can't be a constant, because I plan to have items that will add to them, so for example at level 2 Hero Dude may get + 2 hitpoints, meaning that hitpoints needs to be able to change to 12 instead of being frozen at 10. The same for the other mentioned variables. The way I have seen this done in other games varies. For example, in age of empires 3, stats (i.e. health, movement, attack etc) are placed inside an xml file on a per unit basis.ï_ The format being<attack>6</attack><health>10</health> etc. At that point it must be that the game engine knows what <health> , <attack> and the other values are and how to handle them. i.e. when a unit is attacked the formula is unit receiving the attack takes attack damage of attacker unit minus unit receiving attacks armor value. However, I don't know what type of programing stuctures are on the back end to make the game understand ""hey everything in /entities/hero dude.xml refers to the abilities hero dude has."" Any examples (with or without code) would help a lot! Thank you kindly in advance for your assistance.

class Character:
    def __init__(self, speed, hitpoints, attack, armor):
        self.speed = speed
        self.hitpoints = hitpoints
        self.attack = attack
        self.armor = armor

    def get_armor(self):
        return self.armor

    def add_hitpoints(self, points):
        self.hitpoints += points
Instead ofï_ï_ hero_dude = Character(2, 10, 6, 2)ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ I could go with villian = Character(4, 12, 7, 4)ï_ and call the same class, replacing every instance of Hero_dude with villian. However, I wonder what happens if villian and hero_dude both call the same class at the same time? How is that threading handled? Does villian need his own class?ï_ I also considered adding a gaia class with no attack or armor for non player controlled animals that wander around i.e. deer, chickens.ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ï_ For items, I can create functions that do what the item should. For example, ""sword of double attack"" could be a function which calls a certain characters attack and * 2.ï_ I know games are not easy, but my goal is to start small then move up. I like the OOP model because it seems to suit that method the best. I looked into using arrays for a characters stats, but the syntax looked quite arcane. My first goal for a game is 1 room, 1 player controlled character, 1 enemy; 2d top down view. Something like this:http://www.digitalwhip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/34385-legend_of_zelda_the_-_a_link_to_the_past...Both characters can move north, east, south, and west, and attack. game ends when 1 character health = 0 I have made mods for age of kings the conquers. I was part of a project that (over years) figured out how to edit the stats in that game. i.e. health, movement, armor. Its interesting to note where in that game engine Ensemble Studios used floats and where they used ints.ï_ Floats were used where more precise control was important; balance is key in rpgs. For example, ints are used for health. However, reload time uses the format x.xxx where 1.000 is = to 1 second. so - 0.500 from the reload time, and reload is cut in half. Or to be more precise could -0.100 from reload. The value seems small but makes a big difference when there are 100's of units on the screen.

In a place with honest people it should not be a problem, and all these is based in honesty, so time really doesnït matters.Now I ask you, imagine a person that discover the course in week number seven, they let them do the course, this guy has time and study hard in one week to make all video lectures, exercises and assigments, but he probably wouldït get the certificate because he started later. Do you really think the effort of that guy doesnït deserve that credits beacuse is not fair for the rest of students even if he worked as harder or more than others?. Why should others get the certificate and that person not beacuse he started later?, in equal conditions and being honest with the work, even having less time, he is deserving the credits and certificate.

You must have finished this week's series.2. You must haveï_familiarity of roots (Square and Cube roots)3. You must be familiar with the print function (print() )4. You must not be tired. Attempt this exercise when you're feeling ready.Instructions: Create 2 functions.1. roots - define a function called ""roots""ï_that takes the parameters number and root.2. power - define a function called ""power"" that takes the parameters number and exponent.Description: This program will test your familiarity of Parenthesis,ï_Exponentiation andï_Division operators, Function Definition andï_Variables. If you know the print function (print() ) use it. If you don't, just run it in the IDLE like this:# Press F5 to the editor to use the codes.
>>> roots(25, 2)
5.0
>>> roots(27, 3)
3.0
>>> power(10, 2)

ï_I can__t finish time_from_utc
function in step 6 of this assignment. It__s because I don__t know how to solve
it in _Ðhuman terms_.

ï_ If I knew it, I could translate it into Python
code with much ease and on my own.

ï_Could somebody please explain
in _Ðhuman language_ the steps to solve this problem?

ï_I don__t need to be told what
Python code looks like. I can translate from _Ðhuman language_ to Python on my
own. Thank you very much.

ï_Below are things I think I
know and where I got stumped. Please give me some explanation if I__m wrong or I
don__t know what to do.

ï_1. The assignment has two objectives.
They are:

1.1. to convert a given time
in any time zone to the corresponding time in UTC+0 zone, in 24 hours format. 

1. 2.To convert a given time
in UTC+0 zone to a corresponding time in any other time zone, in 24 hours
format.

ï_2. We__re learning Python
fundamentals. We have to use the half-written functions given to us by the
instructors. We are not allowed to use statements that have not been taught at
this stage of the course. For example, we can__t use IF statement. 

ï_3. This is where I got stumped.

ï_

To solve the problem
presented by time_from_utc, I think I need to use the formula

ï_Local_timeï_ = UTC+0_time ï_+ ï_Offset time

ï_

****
If my formula is WRONG, please tell me what I need to use to convert the time?

ï_

Again,
I just need the solution in _Ðhuman language_. I don__t need to be told what
Python code for this solution looks like. Thank you very much.

ï_I
manually used this function to test the examples given in this function. It
worked until I reached the two examples below, given by the instructors

ï_

Example: 3.1. ï_time_from_utc(-7, 6.0)

ï_ï_ï_ 23.0

ï_ Example 3.2 time_from_utc(-1, 0.0)

ï_ï_ï_ 23.0

Difficulty with example 3.1

Here, ï_my formula yielded result -1. The instructors are
right to state that the time is 23.0. 

ï_But how can I get there
without using Python statements that I have not been taught?

ï_

Difficulty with example 3.2

ï_Here, ï_my formula yielded result -1. The instructors are

Why does Python make slicing more complicated than it should
by making ending index exclusive?



s = _Learn to Program__



In the example above, string s has 16 characters. Let__s say
we want to extract sub string _Program_ from it. Letter P has index 9. Letter m
has index 15.



If we type s[9:15]
then we__ll get _Progra__ because ending index is EXCLUSIVE. So, even though _m____s
index is 15, we have to type s[9:16] to extract _Program__

should?

Negative indices can be thought of as if you were shifting the index to the left from the first element, and rotating counter-clockwise through the last element. This can therefore be thought of as a pointer, and not math. I can only guess that the reason that these problems say that math should not be used is that they do not want any calculations performed such as using the len() function to in any way determine the pointer value. The idea is to teach how to access a list in this manner using only a pointer, whether it be positive or negative. The other idea here also may be to indicate the simplicity in which the element may be accessed. It may be true in some real applications that math may be required to access the desired element.","Tuesday, September 24th 2013, 11:42 am -04:00",2452,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2452, Resolved,"Answer marked wrong, but evaluates correctly in Shell",1380037345,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=10107,Question 7 discussion,0,0

Besides, If you want shift to be a global variable, you needn't pass it as an argument to translate().Another issue is that when shift is assigned user input in caesar(), it really is a local variable (no global declaration there), and (global) variable shift in function find_let() doesn't refer to the same variable. Addingdef caesar():ï_ï_ï_ global shiftwill fix this.Global variable caes is initialised to a list containing an empty string as its first element. The following would do just fine :caes = []With caes being defined as global, it means that function translate() appends characters to global variable caes, then returns it, which is in turn assigned to local variable caes in function caesar().alph is used in your code to test if a character is lower case alphabetic, to return its numeric index, or to return the letter corresponding to a numeric index. Now that you're more familiar with ASCII codes, you could use the ord() function to get letter codes, chr() to get letter from code, and Python's built-in string method isalpha() (as illustrated by Lakka's post below) to test if characters belong to the alphabet.Furthermore, you define variables c and d as global, and initialise them to an empty string. C is used in translate() and d in find_let() but nowhere in those functions are they declared as global, so it means that global variables c and d are practically never used.Finally, concerning your find_let() function, if you wish to make your code shorter, you can notice that you d = alph[t] assignment occurs in both parts of your conditional test. You can safely move this assignment outside of it, like this :def find_let(b):    global shift, t, ceas    if b + shift >= 26:        t = int((b + shift) % 26)    else:        t = int(b + shift)    d = alph[t]    return dHere's an update suggestion for your code (tested in IDLE).","Thursday, August 29th 2013, 7:19 am -04:00",645,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=645,,Mind Food - Extra weekly challenge #2,1377775187,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/list?forum_id=2,Off-topic Discussion,0,0
