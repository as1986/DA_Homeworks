0 -1 str0 Hi all! Today, each of you will be both the instructor and the student. Each of you will be responsible for looking for opportunities for a specific discussion strategy to be used in the conversation.
1 0 str1 Lets get started by introducing ourselves. I am Alex.
2 1 str2 i am {s001}
3 2 str3 Hi {s001} you are the Revoicer. When an explanation or idea is given which would benefit from revoicing, please encourage one of your team mates to do so, for example, by asking them to explain what was said in their own words.
4 3 str4 {s005} you are the Challenger. When you see a statement being made (whether it is right or wrong) which would benefit from being challenged, please encourage one of your team mates to do so, for example, by asking them whether they agree or disagree with what was said, and why.
5 4 str5 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for by looking over pages 7-9 in your book and remembering what role you have been assigned.
6 5 str6 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.
7 6 str7 Nice to meet u 2.
8 7 str8 Please discuss what you predict will happen in these two conditions.
9 8 str9 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
10 9 str10 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
11 10 str11 When you are in agreement, write down your predictions and explanations for Conditions A, B and C on your worksheet.
12 11 str12 You are now going to watch a video showing the cell in Conditions A, B and C.
13 12 str13 As you watch the video, write down your observations on your worksheet.
14 13 str14 Go to the Videos folder on the Desktop, and watch the video which is there.
15 14 str15 I predict that in Condition A the cell model would gain more water and Codition b would loose the water in the cell model
16 15 str16 Is everyone back?
17 16 str17 Now discuss what you observed in the video about conditions A and B. Compare what you observed to your predictions.
18 17 str18 You should now move on to discussing what you observed in the video about condition C. Compare what you observed to your predictions. How is this different from what happened in condition A?
19 18 str19 Ok, I gotta go.
20 19 str20 It was nice talking to you all. :-)
21 20 str21 Nice talking to you two<
22 21 str22 why isnt this working?
23 22 str23 this thing is slow
24 23 str24 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
25 24 str25 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
26 25 str26 When you are in agreement, write down your predictions and explanations for Conditions A, B and C on your worksheet.
27 26 str27 water will be able to get in but the starch wont be able to move out so the tube will expand
28 27 str28 thats for C
29 28 str29 what one are you talking about
30 29 str30 i see you
31 30 str31 C on the chart
32 31 str32 i see you too
33 32 str33 You are now going to watch a video showing the cell in Conditions A, B and C.
34 33 str34 As you watch the video, write down your observations on your worksheet.
35 34 str35 Go to the Videos folder on the Desktop, and watch the video which is there.
36 35 str36 If glucose is placed in the beaker the water in the tube will disapear
37 36 str37 what was the explaination for C and A
38 37 str38 never mind
39 38 str39 Are you guys back?
40 39 str40 is anyone else seriously confused
41 40 str41 {s006}, did you get any other observation other than the weight
42 41 str42 no i didnt write anything down for the observations
43 42 str43 Ok, I gotta go.
44 43 str44 It was nice talking to you all. :-)
45 44 str45 um bye?
46 45 str46 for 1 hour on a it was .620 they were both clear tube and beaker and both strips were green
47 46 str47 same for the B but the weight was .540

55 54 str55 Ok... So the Explainer is s011. When you see a place where it would be good to get more explanation, you can encourage one of your team mates to do that, for example, by inviting that person to add on to what the other student has already said.
56 55 str56 You should probably all mark an X opposite your role in the book, so you won't forget.
57 56 str57 who r u guys

176 175 str176 Ok... So the Explainer is s021. When you see a place where it would be good to get more explanation, you can encourage one of your team mates to do that, for example, by inviting that person to add on to what the other student has already said.
177 176 str177 You should probably all mark an X opposite your role in the book, so you won't forget.
178 177 str178 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for.
179 178 str179 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.
180 179 str180 Please discuss what you predict will happen in these two conditions.
181 180 str181 my name is {s020}

183 182 str183 i dont get this
184 183 str184 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
185 184 str185 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
186 185 str186 i think that it will let water in but not glucose
187 186 str187 s020, do you agree with what s021 is saying?
188 187 str188 i think that the liquid inside will come out
189 188 str189 s022, do you agree with what s020 is saying?
190 189 str190 When you are in agreement, write down your predictions and explanations for Conditions A, B and C on your worksheet.
191 190 str191 i disagree with {s020} because i really dont understand what she just said
192 191 str192 You are now going to watch a video showing the cell in Conditions A, B and C.

194 193 str194 Go to the Videos folder on the Desktop, and watch the video which is there.
195 194 str195 i think that the glucose and distilled water will mix
196 195 str196 what does that mean s022
197 196 str197 {s021} why do you think that the glucose will stay inside
198 197 str198 what does what mean?
199 198 str199 Back from watching the video?
200 199 str200 Now discuss what you observed in the video about conditions A and B. Compare what you observed to your predictions.
201 200 str201 You should now move on to discussing what you observed in the video about condition C. Compare what you observed to your predictions. How is this different from what happened in condition A?

212 211 str212 You should probably all mark an X opposite your role in the book, so you won't forget.
213 212 str213 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for.
214 213 str214 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.
215 214 str215 Please discuss what you predict will happen in these two conditions.
216 215 str216 who is 27
217 216 str217 {s027}
218 217 str218 what do you think'ds going to happen?
219 218 str219 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
220 219 str220 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
221 220 str221 the world is going to end in 2012
222 221 str222 S027, now would be a good time to ask S034 to build on what S041 is saying.
223 222 str223 im so confused!
224 223 str224 034, would you like to build on to what 041 is saying? and me too!
225 224 str225 When you are in agreement, write down your predictions and explanations for Conditions A, B and C on your worksheet.
226 225 str226 You are now going to watch a video showing the cell in Conditions A, B and C.
227 226 str227 ooh. hi
228 227 str228 As you watch the video, write down your observations on your worksheet.
229 228 str229 Go to the Videos folder on the Desktop, and watch the video which is there.
230 229 str230 idk what to do.
231 230 str231 someone predict something
232 231 str232 THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IN 2012 !
233 232 str233 oh i get it! what do you think is going to happen when you put the glucose in the distilled water?
234 233 str234 i think it will turn a different color.
235 234 str235 {s041}?
236 235 str236 ok dude what 27 said
237 236 str237 in your own words
238 237 str238 you have to be more specific 27
239 238 str239 ur one to talk!!!
240 239 str240 the answer to number one : the distilled water will move into the internal envorment of glucose solution
241 240 str241 and the explaination is glucose is denser
242 241 str242 just write what she[{s034}] said.
243 242 str243 for the explination
244 243 str244 #2 the distilled water will move into the external enviroment
245 244 str245 watch the video
246 245 str246 Is everyone back?
247 246 str247 we have to do all the prediction , thats what NACHO said
248 247 str248 ok, but where do i click to watch it?
249 248 str249 Now discuss what you observed in the video about conditions A and B. Compare what you observed to your predictions.
250 249 str250 nevermind i found it.
251 250 str251 #3 the water will move into the starch because starch absorbs it
252 251 str252 S027, now would be a good time to ask S041 to build on what S034 is saying.
253 252 str253 {s034} are these #'s all of the predictions or explanations?
254 253 str254 You should now move on to discussing what you observed in the video about condition C. Compare what you observed to your predictions. How is this different from what happened in condition A?
255 254 str255 #3, is that the prediction?
256 255 str256 Lets spend the rest of the time we have discussing your observations from all the three conditions.
257 256 str257 Discuss explanations of what you observed in each condition and make sure you fill in your explanations on your worksheets.
258 257 str258 what is explanation for #2
259 258 str259 its both, the first part is the prediction the second part is the explanation
260 259 str260 @S027, can you ask S041 to build on what S034 is saying.
261 260 str261 i want to shoot myself in the foot -.-
262 261 str262 this is so stupid.
263 262 str263 this would be so much easier just in a group
264 263 str264 yep yep
265 264 str265 @S027, can you ask S041 to build on what S034 is saying.
266 265 str266 you dont have the balls to do it
267 266 str267 do what?
268 267 str268 Ok, I gotta go.

275 274 str275 i watched most of it
276 275 str276 do you know what happened?
277 276 str277 i just wrote the observations
278 277 str278 oh. what was it after 1 hour for condition A?
279 278 str279 {s041}, did you get everything so far?
280 279 str280 condition a: 620 glucose inside; 635 glucose inside; 630 glucose inside; explanation: the membrane will hold stuff for a certain amount of time
281 280 str281 condition b: 540 glucose outside; 525 glucose outside; 525 glucose outside; explanation: the glucose was not being absorbed by the water
282 281 str282 i think .
283 282 str283 k, i'll fast forward and try to find the last one, when im done writing the condition b.
284 283 str284 you mean i know !
285 284 str285 yea, sure i do, whatever. hahahahahha

294 293 str294 lol thsnks
295 294 str295 is it ur birthday?
296 295 str296 bye bye guys.
297 -1 str297 Hi all! Today, each of you will be both the instructor and the student. Each of you will be responsible for looking for opportunities for a specific discussion strategy to be used in the conversation.
298 297 str298 Lets get started by introducing ourselves. I am Alex.
299 298 str299 s035,s042,s028... i didn't get your names yet.
300 299 str300 Hi S035 you are the Revoicer. When an explanation or idea is given which would benefit from revoicing, please encourage one of your team mates to do so, for example, by asking them to explain what was said in their own words.
301 300 str301 S042, you are the Challenger. When you see a statement being made (whether it is right or wrong) which would benefit from being challenged, please encourage one of your team mates to do so, for example, by asking them whether they agree or disagree with what was said, and why.
302 301 str302 Ok... So the Explainer is S028. When you see a place where it would be good to get more explanation, you can encourage one of your team mates to do that, for example, by inviting that person to add on to what the other student has already said.
303 302 str303 You should probably all mark an X opposite your role in the book, so you won't forget.
304 303 str304 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for.
305 304 str305 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.
306 305 str306 Please discuss what you predict will happen in these two conditions.
307 306 str307 hi, my name is {s035}
308 307 str308 W ho's 35?
309 308 str309 O h this is {s042}
310 309 str310 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
311 310 str311 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
312 311 str312 Yeah. I think that water will try to even out with glucose for the first one
313 312 str313 When you are in agreement, write down your predictions and explanations for Conditions A, B and C on your worksheet.
314 313 str314 You are now going to watch a video showing the cell in Conditions A, B and C.
315 314 str315 ook....so we got the parts.. who else is in the group...and i have no clue what we are doing.... do we just talk about what we think is going to happen to the egg
316 315 str316 As you watch the video, write down your observations on your worksheet.
317 316 str317 Go to the Videos folder on the Desktop, and watch the video which is there.
318 317 str318 oo hey im {s035}!!
319 318 str319 ook group what do we pedict
320 319 str320 I think that the water will seperate and travel to glucose. Because water has a lot of molecules and glucose is just sugar. So it would then balance out. What do you think?
321 320 str321 ook this is what i think...if we put the cell model in the water it will grow like the egg did....but if its in teh sugar it will shrink
322 321 str322 Oh I get it. But wouldn't it still expand and try to balance out?
323 322 str323 i am so confused
324 323 str324 im with {s028} on this one....
325 324 str325 It's like Osmosis I think. If it's water mixed in with sugar like liquid or another solvent it will try to balance out. Like salt. Does that help?
326 325 str326 thankyou! i have nothing written on my paper, i'm a bit stupid
327 326 str327 Back from watching the video?
328 327 str328 no alex, we arent! jeeze!
329 328 str329 Now discuss what you observed in the video about conditions A and B. Compare what you observed to your predictions.
330 329 str330 alright, i am still on A, for the first box thing
331 330 str331 haha its cool and {s042} that is a good idea.... i think we mite have to watch the movie
332 331 str332 what do you guys think?
333 332 str333 we need to watch the movie maybe??
334 333 str334 yeah, i think we should
335 334 str335 I think that it might balance out and that {s035}'s right with the shrinking of the water.
336 335 str336 Yeah we should
337 336 str337 ook were do we go lol
338 337 str338 down at the bottom of the screen
339 338 str339 thnx found it
340 339 str340 You should now move on to discussing what you observed in the video about condition C. Compare what you observed to your predictions. How is this different from what happened in condition A?
341 340 str341 So far it's like consuing and growing
342 341 str342 Lets spend the rest of the time we have discussing your observations from all the three conditions.
343 342 str343 Discuss explanations of what you observed in each condition and make sure you fill in your explanations on your worksheets.
344 343 str344 i think that for C, the predicted change would be that the water will move into the starch
345 344 str345 The glucose weighed it down and then disperssed
346 345 str346 I agree with s028
347 346 str347 Ok, I gotta go.
348 347 str348 It was nice talking to you all. :-)
349 348 str349 wooo now all i need is B! and the entire second box haha
350 349 str350 i still hav eno clue what to write in all the boxes :(
351 350 str351 Okay, I think that when the distilled water is put into the glucose the glucose will get lighter and then well I don't know what then.....
352 351 str352 wouldnt for B, the water will once again shrink because its mixing water with glucose again?
353 352 str353 oh ok, or your prediction haha
354 353 str354 Oh I think it would, but it might expand at first then shrink
355 354 str355 that makes sense
356 355 str356 wouldnt the explanation for C be that starch absorbs water, and thats why the water will move into it?
357 356 str357 the explanation I think would be that since when h20 is put into another solvent it expands its molecules and then maybe it would shrink from the glucose
358 357 str358 Yeah thats what shoud happen for the starch box
359 358 str359 i think we ahuld all write what we think an dthen talk about it
360 359 str360 mkkk. now all we need is the explanation for box A
361 360 str361 Box A I think would be that there's a lot of water and glucose is sugar so it would shrink and like balance
362 361 str362 are we on the first set of boxes of the seconf??
363 362 str363 ok, now we have to watch that stupid video, but didnt he tell us to X out of it?
364 363 str364 I'm restarting the video the 2nd box is confusing....
365 364 str365 mk me too
366 365 str366 ok thnx...for the second st of boxes for the observations change i put all the weights i saw in the movie
367 366 str367 we didnt even take the quiz yet, and i failed hahhaha
368 367 str368 oo great a quiz
369 368 str369 I don't want a quiz
370 369 str370 I think the glocos will get heavier
371 370 str371 bye guys!
372 371 str372 bye bye
373 -1 str373 Hi all! Today, each of you will be both the instructor and the student. Each of you will be responsible for looking for opportunities for a specific discussion strategy to be used in the conversation.
374 373 str374 Lets get started by introducing ourselves. I am Alex.

380 379 str380 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for.
381 380 str381 this is {s036} :)
382 381 str382 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.
383 382 str383 Please discuss what you predict will happen in these two conditions.
384 383 str384 HELLO!? who is there
385 384 str385 HELLO?

388 387 str388 who is so29
389 388 str389 {s029[pet name form]}
390 389 str390 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
391 390 str391 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
392 391 str392 what do we discuss
393 392 str393 who are you?^
394 393 str394 who is dis wats a {s029[pet name form]}
395 394 str395 dis is {s043}
396 395 str396 When you are in agreement, write down your predictions and explanations for Conditions A, B and C on your worksheet.
397 396 str397 who is 29
398 397 str398 You are now going to watch a video showing the cell in Conditions A, B and C.
399 398 str399 As you watch the video, write down your observations on your worksheet.
400 399 str400 Go to the Videos folder on the Desktop, and watch the video which is there.
401 400 str401 {s043} wat are we doing?
402 401 str402 {s029}!
403 402 str403 BOYFRIEND! :)
404 403 str404 haha hey boyfriend!
405 404 str405 WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO WRITE
406 405 str406 ok wat r we doin?
407 406 str407 i think the water will travel into the tube with the gluecose because of osmosis
408 407 str408 for A?
409 408 str409 a? i thought it was #1?
410 409 str410 water will mix with the gluecose to try and balance out the water molecules
411 410 str411 yes for a
412 411 str412 for predicted change?
413 412 str413 wouldn't that be the same for B?
414 413 str414 i need help! ;(
415 414 str415 i think the water will be obsorbed
416 415 str416 for part b
417 416 str417 i think the glucose will dissolve
418 417 str418 there is more gluecose than water outside than inside so the water will come out
419 418 str419 Is everyone back?
420 419 str420 ok can someone help me please!
421 420 str421 how do you know there's more glucose than water outside than inside?
422 421 str422 Now discuss what you observed in the video about conditions A and B. Compare what you observed to your predictions.
423 422 str423 becasue the tube of water is siting inside the container of gluecose
424 423 str424 S036, can you put what S043 said in your own words?
425 424 str425 wait what're we writing for the explanation for each prediction? so far i just have "water will mix with glucose to try to balance out the water molecules" for the predicted change for A
426 425 str426 You should now move on to discussing what you observed in the video about condition C. Compare what you observed to your predictions. How is this different from what happened in condition A?
427 426 str427 Lets spend the rest of the time we have discussing your observations from all the three conditions.
428 427 str428 Discuss explanations of what you observed in each condition and make sure you fill in your explanations on your worksheets.
429 428 str429 for A what did we get for the explanation for prediction.. since i need alot of help!
430 429 str430 wait {s029} did you watch the video already?
431 430 str431 yea dats right for b i jus said the water will b obsorbed because there is more gluecose and the water will travel from a low water level to attempt to go to a higher source of water
432 431 str432 S036, can you put what S043 said in your own words?
433 432 str433 Ok, I gotta go.
434 433 str434 It was nice talking to you all. :-)
435 434 str435 is everybody redy for the video?????
436 435 str436 no no no ! i need the A & C prediction.....
437 436 str437 a-the water will go into the tube because of osmosis
438 437 str438 c-the water will go into the starch
439 438 str439 okayy thankyouu :) now we watch the video?
440 439 str440 what's the predicted change for B?
441 440 str441 noooo!!! i need B and the Explanation for Prediction of each one
442 441 str442 b-i think the water will be obsorbed
443 442 str443 b- water will obsorbed bc there is more gluecose/ the water travel low water level to a higher source? ritght?
444 443 str444 wait, would osmosis be the explanation for A?
445 444 str445 yeah the A "the water will go into the tube bc of osmois"
446 445 str446 idk this is wat she was sayn
447 446 str447 so we're writing "Osmosis" in the box for Explanation?!
448 447 str448 but she is watching the video we are soo lost :(
449 448 str449 hahahh oh dear
450 449 str450 i put for A the explantation prediction of what i said about A lol!
451 450 str451 i only watched a couple seconds of the video so far
452 451 str452 WHERE IS THE VIDEO!?
453 452 str453 at the bottom, next to start it says "combined video"
454 453 str454 i hate psp :'( idk wats goin on
455 454 str455 for the explantion for C i put "stach absorbs liquid and water is a liquid"
456 455 str456 yea i put like the same thing " water will go into the strarch"
457 456 str457 well im going to watch the video lol
458 457 str458 me too!
459 -1 str459 Hi all! Today, each of you will be both the instructor and the student. Each of you will be responsible for looking for opportunities for a specific discussion strategy to be used in the conversation.

482 481 str482 Say "Yes" to let me know you are back from watching the video.
483 482 str483 Now discuss what you observed in the video about conditions A and B. Compare what you observed to your predictions.
484 483 str484 did you guys get it
485 484 str485 i got it
486 485 str486 wat did u observe for 5hrs condition c
487 486 str487 You should now move on to discussing what you observed in the video about condition C. Compare what you observed to your predictions. How is this different from what happened in condition A?
488 487 str488 Ok, I gotta go.

514 513 str514 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for.
515 514 str515 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.
516 515 str516 Please discuss what you predict will happen in these two conditions.
517 516 str517 what do you think will hlappen?
518 517 str518 i think that a and b will turn out the same.
519 518 str519 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
520 519 str520 i think in condition A water will go inside the cell and b will be the oppisite
521 520 str521 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
522 521 str522 what do you think will happpen?
523 522 str523 ok..sound about right
524 523 str524 what wil happen to condition c./
525 524 str525 i have no idea either
526 525 str526 When you are in agreement, write down your predictions and explanations for Conditions A, B and C on your worksheet.
527 526 str527 alrighhttm
528 527 str528 You are now going to watch a video showing the cell in Conditions A, B and C.
529 528 str529 As you watch the video, write down your observations on your worksheet.
530 529 str530 Go to the Videos folder on the Desktop, and watch the video which is there.
531 530 str531 what the explanatiion for what you guys said?
532 531 str532 what do you mean ?
533 532 str533 great help..
534 533 str534 it says whats the explanation for your prediction
535 534 str535 for A i said that water would go inside since gloucuse dissolves in waterr and the membrane would gain weight
536 535 str536 im not sure though
537 536 str537 that sounds gooood.
538 537 str538 ok..what did you put for condition B
539 538 str539 LETS WATCH THE VIDEO IN THE OTHER TAB..
540 539 str540 COUGH COUGH at the bottomof the page
541 540 str541 hahhaha
542 541 str542 waht did you put for conditon c?
543 542 str543 Are you guys back?
544 543 str544 the thing {s031} said?\
545 544 str545 Now discuss what you observed in the video about conditions A and B. Compare what you observed to your predictions.
546 545 str546 i think for c that it would turn purple since the starch would mix with the idione or is it the other way around
547 546 str547 i was thinking the same thing
548 547 str548 You should now move on to discussing what you observed in the video about condition C. Compare what you observed to your predictions. How is this different from what happened in condition A?
549 548 str549 i dont know what this video is doing i cant hear anything and its confusing me
550 549 str550 same here..i cant see the weighto=or anythign
551 550 str551 Ok, I gotta go.
552 551 str552 It was nice talking to you all. :-)
553 552 str553 exactly,
554 553 str554 i dont know how to do any of thiss.
555 554 str555 i got the weight but i can barely see the strips
556 555 str556 for a and b the strips are dark green
557 556 str557 yeaah, i got alll confused and dont know is for which
558 557 str558 whats the weight
559 558 str559 condtion A
560 559 str560 wasnt one like .60
561 560 str561 after 1 hr?
562 561 str562 and then after 5 hours it was .635
563 562 str563 and after 1 day it was .630
564 563 str564 for b it was .540 for 1 hour
565 564 str565 .525 for 5 hours

567 566 str567 and then .525 again for a day
568 567 str568 thankk youu
569 568 str569 ok..whaty about for conditon c?
570 569 str570 i didnt get there yet in the videeooo
571 570 str571 neither did i...what did you put for your observations for a and b
572 571 str572 for c after i hour it was black on the tube and the water outside look kinda yellow and it was .655
573 572 str573 after 5 hours?
574 573 str574 after 5 hours it was .655 and the water still looked yellow
575 574 str575 and then after 24 hours it was .635
576 575 str576 ok and for one day?
577 576 str577 and the water looked lighter than for before
578 577 str578 okkaaaaayyyy. do you guys know why this stuff happpned
579 578 str579 for a....it gained weight because th glucose was obsorbed
580 579 str580 okay and then would it be the oppistie for b
581 580 str581 umm...im not so sure
582 581 str582 iit lost weighht

584 583 str584 what about for c?
585 584 str585 soooo it lost water from inside?
586 585 str586 yeah..weight was lost because the glucose didnt absord all the way
587 586 str587 what would we put for c
588 587 str588 and the last one lost weight
589 588 str589 idk this quiz :(
590 589 str590 mmee either
591 -1 str591 Hi all! Today, each of you will be both the instructor and the student. Each of you will be responsible for looking for opportunities for a specific discussion strategy to be used in the conversation.
592 591 str592 Lets get started by introducing ourselves. I am Alex.
593 592 str593 hi alex
594 593 str594 hi 32 and 46
595 594 str595 s032,s046,s039... i didn't get your names yet.
596 595 str596 im {s039}
597 596 str597 Hi S032 you are the Revoicer. When an explanation or idea is given which would benefit from revoicing, please encourage one of your team mates to do so, for example, by asking them to explain what was said in their own words.
598 597 str598 S046, you are the Challenger. When you see a statement being made (whether it is right or wrong) which would benefit from being challenged, please encourage one of your team mates to do so, for example, by asking them whether they agree or disagree with what was said, and why.
599 598 str599 Ok... So the Explainer is S039. When you see a place where it would be good to get more explanation, you can encourage one of your team mates to do that, for example, by inviting that person to add on to what the other student has already said.
600 599 str600 You should probably all mark an X opposite your role in the book, so you won't forget.
601 600 str601 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for.
602 601 str602 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.
603 602 str603 Please discuss what you predict will happen in these two conditions.
604 603 str604 hi i am {s039}
605 604 str605 hi im {s046}
606 605 str606 hi {s046}
607 606 str607 hey {s053}
608 607 str608 hey {s053} from {s032}
609 608 str609 32 is {s032}
610 609 str610 39 is {s039}
611 610 str611 hi {s039}
612 611 str612 so u know
613 612 str613 hi {s032}
614 613 str614 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
615 614 str615 so what do you think about the first one {s039}
616 615 str616 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
617 616 str617 i dont know i feel stupid do you know {s046}?
618 617 str618 When you are in agreement, write down your predictions and explanations for Conditions A, B and C on your worksheet.
619 618 str619 i think water wil be taken out of the cell because the glucose will harvest the water
620 619 str620 S039, do you agree with what S032 is saying?
621 620 str621 You are now going to watch a video showing the cell in Conditions A, B and C.
622 621 str622 As you watch the video, write down your observations on your worksheet.
623 622 str623 Go to the Videos folder on the Desktop, and watch the video which is there.
624 623 str624 i was going to ask but ok thats sounds right
625 624 str625 yea alex
626 625 str626 who's in my group?
627 626 str627 hahahahha {s046}
628 627 str628 {s046} is mean from {s039}
629 628 str629 your beat
630 629 str630 no she is super beat
631 630 str631 exactly
632 631 str632 okay so what are we doing?
633 632 str633 for solution a i think water will be added to the cell
634 633 str634 my explanation is that the glucose will absorb the water causing the cell to expand
635 634 str635 i think the exact opposite
636 635 str636 lets go to the video
637 636 str637 to my knowledge glucose attractes water but when inside an ienvoronment itll push out water but i could be wrong
638 637 str638 so i like what you siad
639 638 str639 Are you guys back?
640 639 str640 Now discuss what you observed in the video about conditions A and B. Compare what you observed to your predictions.
641 640 str641 alrite what do you think about condition B?
642 641 str642 You should now move on to discussing what you observed in the video about condition C. Compare what you observed to your predictions. How is this different from what happened in condition A?
643 642 str643 i didnt watch it yet
644 643 str644 i think the cell would lose weigtt to because the glucose will extract the water out of the cell
645 644 str645 S039, why dont you do explain the reasons behind what S032 is saying.
646 645 str646 Ok, I gotta go.
647 646 str647 so it turns out i was right according to the video the cell in (a) gained wight and the one in (b) loses wight
648 647 str648 It was nice talking to you all. :-)
649 648 str649 byeee(:
650 649 str650 yea thats what i was thinking {s032}
651 650 str651 i need helpp
652 651 str652 i saw the video condition b will take water out
653 652 str653 so my prediction was right from the start
654 653 str654 condition a is right also.
655 654 str655 so {s039} what you doing saturday nght
656 655 str656 i didnt see the video for condition a though
657 656 str657 hat was weird
658 657 str658 he says idk hahhahah {s033} says hi
659 658 str659 never do that again
660 659 str660 tell i {s033} i say nothing
661 660 str661 awe thats mean
662 661 str662 no its not
663 662 str663 im gonna watch the video to see condition c
664 663 str664 im gonna watch it too to understand whats going on
665 664 str665 fun fact from dr {s032} asdfjkl; are all home row keys
666 665 str666 fun fact from doctor {s032} you can type the word typewriter using only the top row
667 666 str667 also for "C" the starch will come out slowlyu
668 667 str668 slowly
669 668 str669 fun fact lollipop is the longest word you can type using only your left hand
670 669 str670 my explanation is the water will "absorb" the starch causing the cell to decrease
671 670 str671 {s032} its ur right hand
672 671 str672 oh hahahah i meant to say that swear any way
673 672 str673 Hi all! Today, each of you will be both the instructor and the student. Each of you will be responsible for looking for opportunities for a specific discussion strategy to be used in the conversation.

681 680 str681 Ok... So the Explainer is S033. When you see a place where it would be good to get more explanation, you can encourage one of your team mates to do that, for example, by inviting that person to add on to what the other student has already said.
682 681 str682 You should probably all mark an X opposite your role in the book, so you won't forget.
683 682 str683 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for.

685 684 str685 who is 33
686 685 str686 {s033} is 33 haha
687 686 str687 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.
688 687 str688 who is 40
689 688 str689 Please discuss what you predict will happen in these two conditions.
690 689 str690 {s040}

699 698 str699 what do u think will happen to the glucose in the distilled water
700 699 str700 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
701 700 str701 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.

770 769 str770 it is goin 2 get heavier
771 770 str771 Ok... So the Explainer is S062. When you see a place where it would be good to get more explanation, you can encourage one of your team mates to do that, for example, by inviting that person to add on to what the other student has already said.
772 771 str772 kid in the grey hood
773 772 str773 You should probably all mark an X opposite your role in the book, so you won't forget.
774 773 str774 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for.
775 774 str775 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.

780 779 str780 would you stop saying the same thing ovae and over omqq
781 780 str781 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
782 781 str782 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
783 782 str783 i think were suppose to work on our prediction
784 783 str784 When you are in agreement, write down your predictions and explanations for Conditions A, B and C on your worksheet.
785 784 str785 You are now going to watch a video showing the cell in Conditions A, B and C.
786 785 str786 As you watch the video, write down your observations on your worksheet.
787 786 str787 umm a you can say that when you mix them together the colors will change and something may happen..okay
788 787 str788 Go to the Videos folder on the Desktop, and watch the video which is there.
789 788 str789 wacth the video
790 789 str790 okay so do you want to put that down
791 790 str791 who is this anyway
792 791 str792 Is everyone back?
793 792 str793 {s059}...and we can say when you mix them together the color changes and they have different weight
794 793 str794 Now discuss what you observed in the video about conditions A and B. Compare what you observed to your predictions.
795 794 str795 glucose will dissolve in the distilled water
796 795 str796 put in what box
797 796 str797 predicted change
798 797 str798 umm or you going to say somthinq back
799 798 str799 thanks
800 799 str800 You should now move on to discussing what you observed in the video about condition C. Compare what you observed to your predictions. How is this different from what happened in condition A?
801 800 str801 iin thee ontha box ii put when they are put together they will dissolve in the distilled water....okay
802 801 str802 {s059} guess who this is
803 802 str803 Ok, I gotta go.
804 803 str804 It was nice talking to you all. :-)

828 827 str828 Ok... So the Explainer is S057. When you see a place where it would be good to get more explanation, you can encourage one of your team mates to do that, for example, by inviting that person to add on to what the other student has already said.
829 828 str829 You should probably all mark an X opposite your role in the book, so you won't forget.

843 842 str843 oo ok. i got it
844 843 str844 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
845 844 str845 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
846 845 str846 this guy is smart

875 874 str875 Hi all! Today, each of you will be both the instructor and the student. Each of you will be responsible for looking for opportunities for a specific discussion strategy to be used in the conversation.
876 875 str876 Lets get started by introducing ourselves. I am Alex.
877 876 str877 who is in my group
878 877 str878 s058,s061,s064... i didn't get your names yet.
879 878 str879 Hi S058 you are the Revoicer. When an explanation or idea is given which would benefit from revoicing, please encourage one of your team mates to do so, for example, by asking them to explain what was said in their own words.
880 879 str880 S061, you are the Challenger. When you see a statement being made (whether it is right or wrong) which would benefit from being challenged, please encourage one of your team mates to do so, for example, by asking them whether they agree or disagree with what was said, and why.
881 880 str881 Ok... So the Explainer is S064. When you see a place where it would be good to get more explanation, you can encourage one of your team mates to do that, for example, by inviting that person to add on to what the other student has already said.
882 881 str882 You should probably all mark an X opposite your role in the book, so you won't forget.
883 882 str883 Its nice to meet you all. :) Please make sure you have understood what you are responsible for.
884 883 str884 In condition A, we placed a glucose solution inside the cell model and immerse it in distilled water. In condition B, we did the opposite.
885 884 str885 Please discuss what you predict will happen in these two conditions.

895 894 str895 In condition C, we made a modification to condition A. We replace the glucose solution with a starch suspension. In order to detect the presence of starch, we replace the distilled water with Lugol's Iodine solution.
896 895 str896 You should now move on to discussing what will happen in Condition C and your explanation for this change.
